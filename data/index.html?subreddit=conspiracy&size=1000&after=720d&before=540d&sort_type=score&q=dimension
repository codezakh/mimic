You know it doesn't work like that, right? Do you really want me to respond to that gibberish? I mean, I can...  It's rife with logical errors. Not the least of which is:\n\nAliens existing necessitates extra dimensional space existing and then assuming that there is some sort of \"entity\" that exists therein. \n\nMaybe you mean they exist in some - non-Euclidean state? Fuck, if I know. I don't think you really mean anything...\n\nI mean... that's a hell of a jump with absolutely no reasoning provided.  Maybe you just forgot it. Crazier yet, though... you confuse geometric dimension with what appears to be sci fi dimension... and wager a guess at how such a creature would perceive a 3d object.  \n\nHonestly, this is just way too bonkers to really discuss.\n\nBut lets assume everything in your rambling comment is true. I believe in an infinite universe, aliens exist.  This somehow necessitates \"extra dimensional entities.\" You know how they would perceive us, and they would think that the world looked \"flat.\"\n\nHow on earth do you think that means that I believe the earth is flat? Are you, seriously, saying that because we would employ a different subjective term to describe a round sphere.... it's not actually a round sphere?\n\nNow: if you're just pulling my leg... bravo, I guess?\n\n",

I live in OKC and just to the East is Tinker Air Force Base, where they maintain the US AWACS Radar Fleet.  We grew up knowing we were an early target if Russia ever decided to launch their nukes...and Regan was all too willing to hype this fear at every opportunity.\n\nIt was difficult to be positive and up beat when faced with annihilation but then again, it's not.  It's all a matter of focus.  What you focus on determines your reality.\n\nDon't believe me?  Ok....I use the stop light analogy to illustrate the point.\n\nTwo cars pull of the a stoplight.  In the first car is a woman who's running late to an important appointment.  She's under a tremendous amount of pressure in her life and as every second ticks by, she's getting angrier and angrier because she's becoming later and later.  In the second car is a woman that is thankful for the red light.  She gets a breather, a respite, a break from the chaos of her life.  She looks around and notices all the little birds flying every which way, she notices the beautiful green trees set against the background of a beautiful blue sky with white puffy clouds and she breathes deep and relaxes into the moment.\n\nNow - both women experienced the exact same stimulus, the red light, but both are experiencing VERY different realities because of their focus.  \n\nIf you want to experience a different reality, change your focus and what you perceive will change accordingly.  \n\nAlso if you want to check out some cooler things about consciousness check out /r/DimensionalJumping or the book [Exploring the 5th Dimension](https://www.drbrucegoldberg.com/fifth-dimension-book.html) or any number of other resources about how powerful our minds are.  One classic is [Think and Grow Rich](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Grow-Rich-Napoleon-Hill/dp/149617545X) which I'm sure you can find at your local library.\n\nOne helpful thing to remember about fear is that it's simply an acronym for:  \n**F**alse  \n**E**vidence    \n**A**pearing  \n**R**eal  \n\nIt just appears real but just because it appears that way doesn't make it true.  Just ignore it and live your life however you want.  \n\nCheers!",

Let's say that in one reality, you left your keys on the table, while in yours, you lost them. If those two realities bump into each other, they could swap a part of it, and you will be the one who placed their key on the table rather than losing it. This is rather local though and not a very big change either. The reason most \"glitches\" or \"mendela effects\" aren't that big of a change is because these dimensions or \"world lines\" are close to each other. The more actions/events that had to change, the further away it is from ours.\n\nThat's why only minimal changes like word/name spellings, maybe a lost item found in it's usual spot, the color of a shirt, a new obvious stain on your graduation tux, things like that. Usually only the closest world line/dimension bumps into ours. That's why you don't have anyone coming from Post WWIII or some other catastrophe, because the changes to events or actions would have to be much more numerous than it would for what I've described above.\n\nThere have also been telescopes in space that have detected radiation far more powerful than it should be, and scientists have said that it could be dimensions bumping into each other allowing that radiation to leak through.\n\nSo we get to the Bernstein vs Bernstain argument. It's a very small change, just one letter. If we bumped into a dimension where it was spelled Bernstein, then it could switch and we would have that spelling changed. Having that many people have the spelling changed for them is not normal.",

Roosevelt was his great hero.[65] He moved to the right in the 1950s, became a Republican in 1962, and emerged as a leading conservative spokesman in the Goldwater campaign of 1964.[66]\n\n&gt;In his early political career, he joined numerous political committees with a left-wing orientation, such as the American Veterans Committee. He fought against Republican-sponsored right-to-work legislation and supported Helen Gahagan Douglas in 1950 when she was defeated for the Senate by Richard Nixon. It was his realization that Communists were a powerful backstage influence in those groups that led him to rally his friends against them.[67]\n\n&gt;Reagan spoke frequently at rallies with a strong ideological dimension; in December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the Warner Bros. studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency, specifically his opposition to mutual assured destruction, and he built on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.[68] In the 1948 presidential election, Reagan strongly supported Harry S. Truman, appearing on stage with him during a campaign speech in Los Angeles.[69] However, in the early 1950s, as his relationship with actress Nancy Davis grew,[70] he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as Richard Nixon in 1960.[71]\n\n&gt;He was hired by General Electric (GE) in 1954 to host the General Electric Theater, a weekly TV drama series. He also traveled across the country to give talks to over 200,000 GE employees as a motivational speaker. His many speeches\u2014which he wrote himself\u2014were non-partisan but carried a conservative, pro-business message; he was influenced by Lemuel Boulware, a senior GE executive. Boulware, known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers, championed the core tenets of modern American conservatism: free markets, anticommunism, lower taxes, and limited government.[72] Eager for a larger stage, but not allowed to enter politics by GE, he quit and formally registered as a Republican.[73] He often said, \"I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.\"[74]\n\nThis is way more experience than Trump.",

So instead, Esau and his offspring would attempt to force the blessing simply by living by the sword until the end days (Book of Genesis)\n\nSo with that in mind, the Rothschilds themselves are actually Semitic because they are the offspring of Issac. Which means they are Edomite Hebrews. \n\nSee in a way it is semantics because they never claim to be the real Jews, they claim to be the Jewish. This is also why Rothschild funded the Zionist state of Israel (Red Supremacy) which you will find no mention of THE STATE OF ISRAEL in the Bible. \n\nAnother semantic you will find is that there is no mention of the Israeli in the Bible, it's the *Israelite's*, so technically they have never told a lie because people don't know the truth.\n\nNow if you want to get even deeper, [even the \"Orthodox Jews\" know they are not the real Jews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soheUZ1ERBY) but are in fact of Edom and continued the *religion* of *Judaism* which was formed during the captivity of the real Israelites. \n\nThey worship the [TALMUD (BAAL)](https://youtu.be/21zvuzPnZOI), the real Hebrews worshiped the TORAH (Yahawah). \n\nThere is a difference because the Bible said all these things will be searched out during the end times. \n\nNow see, if you really want to get into it, the Bible states that in the end, the head will become to the tail.\n\n**BLESSING FOR REAL ISRAELITE'S FOR FOLLOWING COMMANDMENTS**\n\n&gt;Deuteronomy 28:13King James Version (KJV)\n\n&gt;13 **And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail;** and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:\n\n**CURSES FOR REAL ISRAELITE'S FOR NOT FOLLOWING COMMANDMENTS**\n&gt;Deuteronomy 28:44-46King James Version (KJV)\n\n&gt;44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: **he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.**\n\nNow if you look at the pyramid of things, Rothschild = Red Shield (ESAU) but the other brother looked like everyone else at the time. If you simply use the spirit to discern, if Rothschild's nation is the richest family on the planet (HEAD) all you have to do is guess who is the poorest nation of people on the planet (TAIL). Then you have found the real Israelite's.\n\nThat is the switch the most high is pushing into this 3rd dimension because the curses are lifting up. This also means we are almost at the end.\n\n&gt;2 Esdras 6:9\n\n&gt;\u201cFor Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginning of it that followeth.\u201d ",

Two different types of white light.\n\n&gt; But I toss it out so I don't get brushed off by skeptics cause I'm still partially skeptical of the whole thing myself (and the majority of my peers as skeptics.\n\nBe careful with skepticism.  It is no less a dogmatic disease as blind religious zealotry.  There\u2019s really no difference between the blind religious zealot and the blind skeptic.  They\u2019re just at opposite ends of the \u201cdenial\u201d spectrum.\n\nI\u2019d say work more toward simply being a critical thinker than a skeptic per se.\n\n&gt; As for needing to breath while I was in the light I, don't remember.\n\nThere was no \u201cphysical you\u201d while you were in the light, so there was no need to breathe there - certainly not in the physical, third dimensional scope of the word anyway.\n\n&gt; I had to swim back in alone crying and gasping for air.\n\nSo you almost drowned, but even though no one came to help you, you managed to swim yourself all the way back to shore?  How were you able to do that if you had almost just drowned moments before?  Sounds pretty scary actually.\n\n&gt; One side being its natural(brain or psychosis) and the other being it's all real.\n\nBrain/psychosis is all real too though.\n\n&gt; Could have been a guardian turning me around in line.\n\nYep.  Possibly.  Someone saying \u201cNope.  It\u2019s not your turn yet.\u201d\n\n&gt; To see and hear things in this reality is one thing but to have them in say a dream state or near death experience leaves room for the easily explainable. \n\nNot if what you experience in the dream state has a direct influence or causal corollary in the waking state.  If I dream that I went to the grocery store and saw a girl in a yellow dress I\u2019d never known or seen before, started talking to her, found out her name was Mary and that she\u2019s from Oregon\u2026and then later on that day while I was awake, I go to the store and THAT EXACT SAME THING HAPPENS\u2026then there\u2019s simply no \u201cskepticism\u201d to work through.  You had an absolutely synchronistic event that cannot be explained by modern MSM science (\u201c$cience\u201d).  Simple as that.\n\n&gt; I'm kind of one of those \"have to see it to believe it\" types.\n\nI\u2019d say maybe not because you\u2019ve already had various anomalous experiences in your life and yet you still doubt their validity.\n\n&gt; But as you can tell I'm still open to suggestion.\n\nBe open to critical thinking and logic is all you have to be open to really.\n\n&gt; More along the lines of the white light and my experiences may have just been mere hormones and brain chemicals on over drive.\n\nThat may have been what happened in *your* case, but there have been far too many cases where some of the things that people see while in the white light get verified in the physical, third dimensional state, and they are things the person in question had no way or knowing beforehand.\n\nLike a 15 year old girl who\u2019s an only child, born and raised in Alabama dies.  Goes into the light.  Meets up with a beautiful 9 year old boy she\u2019s never seen before.  He tells her his name is Roger and that he\u2019s her brother.  He says \u201cTell mom and dad I said hello.  And tell mom to stop kicking herself over what happened after school in Wyoming.  It wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d\n\nGirl is brought back to life, and after she\u2019s stable and her parents come to see her, she tells her mom what happened.\n\nMom sobs uncontrollably.  Girl finds out parents never told her that before she was born her parents had a child named Roger who got hit by a car after deciding to walk home from school because mom was very late picking him up.\n\nAccounts like this are replete in NDE literature.\n\nYour white light might be explained away,  Cases like the one above one, however, can\u2019t be.\n\n&gt; To put it bluntly if I was certifiably dead tomorrow and was standing over my corpse in the morgue I would probably question whether I was actually dead.\n\nThat\u2019s not an intelligent critical thinker, however.  That\u2019s simply someone who doubts just to doubt - someone who\u2019s taken skepticism to absurd lengths.  You can doubt that you and I have been communicating back and forth with one another too.  You can doubt that you\u2019re even communicating with another human being right now.  I could just be a complicated, intelligent program.  Sure.  A critical examination of all the known facts of the world we live in, however, should help you throw out almost any option other than that your *actually* communicating with a live human being (me) right now.\n\nSimilarly, if you died and are standing above your own dead corpse looking down at it, and none of the people around the dead corpse respond to your trying to get their attention\u2026then you can reasonably come to the *non-skeptical* conclusion that A) they can\u2019t see or hear you, and B) you\u2019re still alive and your personal identity has survived the expiration of the physical body you were previously using as a vehicle.\n\n&gt; I'd most likely be standing there trying to make \"logical\"(scientific) sense of it all.\n\nBut I just finished making scientific sense of it in my response/example above.  What you\u2019re doing is using a particularly caustic variant of science that\u2019s much more like \u201c$cience\u201d that has gotten people to stop being actual critical thinkers and gotten them to, instead, doubt just for the very sake of doubting.  That\u2019s a different thing altogether from actual science and critical thinking.\n\n&gt; I figure my lack of a religious upbringing leaves me questioning more than going on faith with this matter.\n\nIt has nothing to do with religion one way or the other.  You can be the most non-religious person in the world, but if you\u2019re truly logical and truly an intelligent, critical thinker, then you\u2019ll go where the evidence and the data logically, rationally leads you *regardless* of whether it\u2019s something that the MSM tells you is \u201chogwash\u201d or not.\n\nDon\u2019t confuse skepticism for intelligence.  Too many people do nowadays - and they shouldn\u2019t, for skepticism is only to doubt\u2026and doubting is good IF YOU HAVE GOOD CAUSE FOR IT.  If you actually have a more logical reason for moving toward A rather than B, however, then it should never matter *what* B actually is or that it might be contrary to or go outside of the physical or what\u2019s popular in this society, etc.\n\nAgain, this is not about religion one way or the other.  This is simply about intelligence and critical thinking.\n\n&gt; For me to 100% believe my own experiences I'd need to be fully aware and not under any type of stress.\n\nBut I\u2019d say you don\u2019t actually mean that.  For example, you very much believed you were about to drown, didn\u2019t you?  Your belief was so powerful that you screamed and cried out to anyone and everyone around to help you, right?  Yet you were under *terrible* stress at that time.  This shows that stress is not a factor the effects what you do and don\u2019t believe.\n\n&gt; Example would be while sitting here answering your questions a bright light starts to form. I'd need it to happen in this reality if you know what I'm saying.\n\nIf you have an experience in one reality \u201cA\u201d that has a direct corollary and effect in *this* reality \u201cB\u201d, then one would be rather remiss to deny the validity and external existence of A.\n\n&gt; The only reason I can say I believe in paranormal activity what ever they may be is because my experiences were not under duress. That and 4 other dudes plus guests every day for almost a year all saw, heard, smelled the same things.\n\nSo then if you\u2019re aware of the existence of paranormal activity, then you understand that there are things that are intelligent and that are not limited to existing in this physical third dimension alone.\n\nOnce you understand this fact, then you *necessarily* have to concede to the possibility of the existence of all *kinds* of other worlds and identities.",

Many but probably not all scientists would agree to this.\n\nOur solar system as far as I've researched is going through very rare (25,000 - 50,000 year) but almost unbearable energetic waves. I say almost because some will not be able to bare it. You'll start seeing apparitions, certain friends will act crazier and crazier.\n\nAssuming no earth based disasters like war, disease, asteroid hits etc, I believe the key to overcome these increasing waves of solar energy will be in self-purity. Because we are *light* at our core, we need to stop consuming impure food, lotions, deodorant, dark or negative thoughts, and emanate more light.\n\nThis is why Law of One refers to our planet being in 3rd density. It makes more sense if you think of vibration and light from our one reality as perhaps moving through air - a gas - a liquid in its own bubble etc. \n\nNow take the two paragraphs above together. Do you see how if solar energy is increasing many times every day, there will be an inflection point? We do not know exactly what that will look like, but people that move with the planet into a much higher vibration, or 4th density as it will be, must *by nature* have to also be of a higher vibration, in sync with the planet's graduation.",

Nothing in this universe is of an \"even\" balance. It just cancels itself out, no wave interference.\nNow if we take the numbers 360 and add the single digits we get \n3+6=9 Now that's a much better number for the universe to play with :)\nIf you checked my youtube playlist you might have noticed that the two waves are related. The \"destructive\" (physical) wave travels a distance of 360 frames. The \"harmonic\" (spiritual) wave travels a distance of 720 frames 2 X 360. When 360 is doubled instead of emitting the same pattern over a longer period of time it forms a higher dimension over the shorter wave. I hope I'm not losing you so back to 432hz. You have probably done the maths already and noticed that it adds up to 9, good number! 432hz will ring into infinity but I don,t hold much hope for poor old 440hz.\nAll the 666 symbolism is playing the same game. It's the Earths area code, the physical, material realm, The left thinking brain, the box, the cage, the cell, the cube, carbon, male, fire. \nFlip it on its head and we get 999, or 27, or reverse=72, 720.  the right creative brain, the spiritual, liberation, female, heaven etc..\nThe key is to balance these two attributes of self and take your  seat at the bridge. It's simply a battle to find that equilibrium\nwithin yourself. Many enlightened humans have tried saying this time and time again. It just gets lost in translation. Most don't see it until it hits them like a train, normally in the last few seconds of life and that's makes me so sad. that's why I am doing this, 666 is winning.\nPlay 432hz for the Universes sake. 666, 999 = balance.\nPeace.\n\n",

Hence the reason for my link to the Advent of Ahriman essay.\n\nIf more and more people are aware of this the dark powers will start to lose their grip. And a lot of people are already aware but they have to have the strength and bravery to keep pushing this awareness forward...and that means we need to start taking the spiritual world seriously and adjust our physical earth lives accordingly.\n\nAnd to digress back to the argument that this \"spirituality\" thing is just hippie nonsense look at it this way. The spiritual afterlife and the unseen angels and demons all around us are just operating on another plane of existence, another dimension. A dimension that is inaccessible to us unless we tune our consciousness in properly.\n\nAll of this is possible through the study of anthroposophy or spiritual science.

I was under the impression this page was suppose to be a relatively non-partisan page? if you like Donald good for you, congrats on the win, but how about sticking to the DNC related conspiracies, I won't come in and tell you you're being \"too paranoid\", but for those of us that don't like trump, let us have our discussions about trump, he is about to be president and does do things in a very different way that most of us haven't seen, we don't need you telling us how OUR conspiracies are simply excessive paranoia.........it seriously feels like every page that use to be worth a shit on Reddit is being brigaded by this cult......... \n\nBesides, isn't this entire subreddit intended to debate whether or not lizard people from the 7th dimension are secretly controlling us like a game of sims from the moon? not too defend politicians......

When I had a vivid dream of another dimension 2 years ago at first I saw mountains rising up fast in a vast plane and then there were monitors on top of the mountains showing people's happy faces, I rose up in the sky and there were thousands of clear beings spiraling around 2 bright red spheres in the distance, the only other red things were their hearts and veins going through their body with lots in the brain. The air felt electric and fluid-like, one came closer and through the barrier turned into a beautiful human like being and stared and smiled at me for a few seconds, I woke up with the most euphoric feeling. Soon after that experience they attacked me with really scary voices and I'm pretty sure electronic weapons that made me very angry/depressed and gave me UTI (urinary tract infection) which lot of abductees report (saw lot of flashes of white light in the air which they've done another time when my programming was really heavy, they told me I was cloned with V2K and abducted 17 times with voice of god weapon...I'm not sure what to believe anymore lol)   ",

Other dimensions could go into the more simple configurations of matter, others possibly into the abstract and unrecognizable versions from our perspective here. \n\nScience has to catch up to metaphysics on this issue, imo. I think they did have a step ahead in one of the Philadelphia experiments where they bent the veil in an odd way. As usual there is more to it than what is released but they didn't understand really they were blinking in and out and in again between parallel dimensions. But in the reconfiguration is where they were put back together with that affect.\n\nThe idea is that all dimensions occupy the same space, only the caveat is the veil. Where you are sitting now, in your space there are also countless dimensions occupying it, only your perception creates a veil that encloses you in this dimension though simultaneously a perspective also shares your location and perceives an entirely different dimension. So another thing string is missing is the perceivers consciousness and how that is accessing other dimensions constantly through inner mechanisms of the imagination. \n\nThey know a particle is doing this blinking in and out, they don't know where it goes when it goes out.

            "body": "The following is from a letter printed in the UK publication, Fortean Times #165 1/03 it is by one of the actors who was a \"Lone Gunman\": \"Having just finished your article on 9/11 conspiracy theories (FT 162:30-33), I thought I'd share with you my own peculiar relationship between the conspiracies and the events. I was on of the lead actors on a short-lived television series that aired on the Fox network in the United States. It was called the 'Lone Gunmen' and intended as a spin-off from the popular Fox series 'The X-Files'. The so-called Lone Gunmen are three conspiracy geeks who publish an underground newspaper named 'The Lone Gunman' (hence our show title).\n\nAlthough our series aired in the spring of 2001, we had shot the pilot episode in March 2000. The plot was fairly simple: The Lone Gunmen uncover and defeat a government conspiracy to fly a commercial jet plane into one of the towers of the World Trade Center via ground-based computer control of the jet's auto-pilot. The intention was to blame a foreign, 'terrorist' nation for the bombing, and thus encourage the US to enter into a war against it-all to guarantee weapons sales for the US military-industrial complex. In the TV episode, of course, our characters save the day in the nick of time, regaining control of the plane just as it soars over the towers.\n\nWe shot 12 more episodes over the winter of 2000-2001, and they all aired on Fox that spring, but in the end our series was not renewed for a second season. I continued to work on 'The X-Files', and I was in Los Angeles on 11 September, having just finished working on an episode of that show. I was supposed to fly home to Canada that very day. I was woken about 8:30 by a phone call from the limo company contracted to drive me to Los Angeles Airport (LAX). \"This is your limo driver,\" the voice told me. \"You won't be flying home today.\"\n\n\"Why not,\" I asked groggy from sleep.\n\n\"All the airports in the US have been shut down.\"\n\nIt took a moment or two to process this statement. I could believe that LAX had been closed for some reason. But all the airports? In the whole country? \"What? Why?\"\n\n\"Someone has flown a plane into the World Trade Center.\"\n\nThey say that most people thought it was a joke when they first heard of the attack. You can understand why that was my first thought. Luckily I was too sleepy to laugh out loud. (Actually, I thought it was a pretty poor joke.) I can only add that once I learned the truth, I experienced an eerie terror, as if I had seen the future, and not understood until it was too late.\n\nAssuming the idea for flying a plane into the Twin Towers by the remote control of a secret government agency was original to our writers, it had been floating around fr a year and a half at least before the actual attack. Not a lot of viewers saw our show (several million maybe saw the pilot), but I have no doubt that the idea-or cultural 'meme'-was immediately available once the shock of the attack wore off.\n\nOf course, it also means the the idea of terrorists flying a jet into a New York landmark was not so unthinkable as it seemed in the days afterwards. As far as news items being 'scrubbed', I think it's safe to say that our pilot, if not our entire series, will never be seen on network television anywhere. Ever. A strange, awful confluence of pulp culture and realty....\"-Bruce Harwood (aka 'Byers' of 'the Lone Gunmen', Fox Broadcasting, Los Angeles)\n\nIt was word for word (including the word \"bombing\"). I respect FT (gentlemen start your online shopping in 3,2,1...), but that particular issue had an article about the Vatican trying to suppress a time-travelling exorcist (with the pope burning a photo of Jesus-I mean why JC? Why not Sinead O' Connor?). So....take that as you will.\n\nI remember when \"Lone Gunmen\" as a spin-off was being promoted (I still have the videotapes with the commercials). It was a flash, then it was gone. They later killed off the Lone Gunmen characters themselves in an episode aptly entitled \"Jump the Shark\" (as if to say the show was impotent during the Robert Patrick times). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_the_Shark_(The_X-Files)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_the_Shark_(The_X-Files).\n\nWas it a warning? Was it a Riddler-style taunting hint/Cabal weaved into an area only the \"nutty loser\" dare tread? Was it coincidence (you got everything from rap album covers, to ill-fated WTC-dwelling artists depicting themselves as St. Sebastian getting hit with planes, I myself had a dream about it in 1997.-something that powerfully traumatic can't resist causing some 4th-dimension defying ripple to lodge itself cryptically in the collective unconscious where some may get access to little snippets.)?.....My thing is, if it were only \"coincidence\" why wouldn't the press say \"Hey. here's one for the strange books...\"? It's sensationalist enough. Better still, if it were an \"inspiration\" for the terrorists, another thing for the press to feed on.\n",

I just think that enough blue-eyed people combined with logic would be effectively the same as the troll's public statement. I agree that every dawn n, you know that there aren't exactly n blue-eyed people. But, if there's enough people, then everyone knows that everyone knows that there has to be more than 1, so why even wait for the first dawn? Maybe it's because the \"everyone knows\" stretches into infinity, and the human brain can't handle it. I know it's hard to visualize a 5th dimensional vector. You can do 4 if you think of time as the 4th dimension, but even then it's hard.\n\nThere are probably holes in the following logic, but I spent a really long time on it, so I'll put it up anyway so it doesn't go to waste.\n\nCompare what the people know from logic and what they can see, to the effect of the troll's statement in more restricted situations.\n\nIf I see at least 1, then I know there's at least 1, but I don't know what anyone else knows. It's as if I heard the troll, but I don't know if anyone else did. For example, maybe the troll is at the center of a [panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon), and I'm in one of the cells. There are other people there, but I can't see them.\n\nIf I see at least 2, then I know everyone sees at least 1. It's as if the panopticon is made of glass, and I can see through it, but it could be one-way glass for all I know, so I don't know if anyone else can see through it.\n\nIf I see at least 3, then I know everyone sees at least 2, and I know everyone knows that everyone sees at least 1. It's as if I know the panopticon is made of regular glass, so I know everyone can see through it, but I don't know if the other people know that.\n\nIf I see at least 4, then I know that everyone sees at least 3, and I know everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone sees at least 1. It's as if I know that everyone knows the panopticon is made of regular glass, so everyone knows everyone can see through it, but I don't know if the other people know that everyone knows.\n\nIf I see at least 5, then I know that everyone sees at least 4, and I know everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone sees at least 1. It's as if I know that everyone knows that everyone knows the panopticon is made of regular glass. At this point, the walls might as well not be there.\n\nEDIT: Maybe at this point, you have to prove that we're not in the Matrix, and I'm not a brain in a jar.

            "body": "The person who wrote this clearly knows nothing about Mexico (and perhaps too much about the novel \u2018Aztec\u2019). The families which constitute the Mexican oligarchy look physically nothing like \u201cAztecs\u201d (i.e. Nahuatls); they would be racially offended to be likened to them (for they are inveterately racist\u2013perhaps even more than they are classist); though of course they look to conceal it, holding inherited dual Spanish-Mexican citizenship is among them far more the norm than the exception. It is true that these families are overwhelmingly centered in Mexico City, the ancient Aztec capital, however, the Aztecs of old did not expel exogenous indigenous tribes, they enslaved them, and to this day the Mexican oligarchy pauperizes their descendants. The U.S. supports this oligarchy wholeheartedly, it is the \u2018comprador\u2019 class lifted to global-level oligarchic status in self-serving complicity with Washington-fueled neoliberal designs. Trump intends to make Mexico even more of a slave to this same exploitative mold, to make of its leadership no longer a \u2018partner in crime\u2019 to neoliberal exploitation, but themselves sadistically humiliated subjects of a new, revived Anglo-Saxon hegemonic bloc that will piratically go across the world sowing and exploiting atavistic racial tensions and animosities to the furthest extent possible, at least enough to revolutionize politics in the U.S. for decades to come, and to racially capture a permanent bloc of the white U.S. working class so that its economic ressentiments are enduringly deflected, redirected, and projected against any and all save for the super-majority white American oligarchy itself. The model is the U.S. itself circa pre-WWII: to refashion a society of general white high employment in exchange for false consciousness-generated near total political dependability and fealty to the new Republican party; a white nationalist party, the membership of which, insulated from historical and humanistic truth, is to lie captured and enveloped in a permanent cocoon of high capitalist-contrived and controlled propagandistic fog from which there is meant to be no escape for them and their even more benighted descendants.\n\nThe Trump administration has already started poking/threatening Iran. I suspected the inclusion of Iran in the new exclusionary immigration orders was in preparation for further acts of symbolic and potentially eventually \"kinetic\" aggression against it. So I will reiterate what I said previously: \"I am concerned that Trump in his immigrant entry prohibitions is evincing sadism tout court and/or an act in preparation for war (you do not do what Trump is presently doing without giving the least prior notice unless you are making a declaration of open and direct hostilities and/or are engaging in the most denuded of demagogies). Trump has since the primaries evinced extremely strong sadistic tendencies; this is likely a personal preference and appetite on his part, but it also functions as a demagogic whetting or instruction in psycho-political sadism (inherent in oligarchic fascism), i.e. in the promotion, legitimization, intensification, and popularization of tendencies equivalent to sadism and Sadean personality traits in preparation for an initiation of open hostilities (though, at least initially, short of outright war) against significant nations and economic blocs of the world (Mexico, Middle East, China, EU) and against important, yet ostensibly foreign-like, demographic sectors within the U.S.: African Americans, Latinos, Muslims, Native Americans, even the \u201cunreliable\u201d majority of women concerned with equitable reproductive health access, etc.\nNationally, the logic of such a \u201cpolitical sadism\u201d would be in perfect complementarity with the international version: generalize the most divisive ethos short of actual militarized (dictatorially oppressive) action through full spectrum utilization of media in the service of an oligarchy that feels itself receding from relative and absolute power in a world ever more immersed in freely globalized trade (to reiterate, to the relative detriment of American hegemonic political and economic power). Trump, standard bearer for an oligarchy opportunistically directly stepping \u201cforward to the plate,\u201d promises millions of industrial sector jobs in a newly, if principally industrially, autarkic U.S. Maybe he will deliver in the mid to long term on this promise, in the immediate to short term his \u201cachievements\u201d will be essentially denagatory , denialist, negative, censorious: civic/humanitarian prohibitions, restrictions, dis-protections in the name of greater national security and policial exigencies; per oligarchic rationalizing protocol, best that the populace become ever more inured and desensitized to such civic and societal (oligarchically optative) harshness by being imbued in the \u201cmodelic\u201d sadism of a personally autarkic-hyper-capitalist cult leader figure (the effective opposite of Clinton\u2019s \u201cStronger Together\u201d): a sort of antipodal dimension Chairmen Mao of capitalist autarky (whose vision is to export, impose, and disseminate the same discoherent ideology throughout the world and have the U.S. be the isolationist leader of an isolationized world).\"\n\nAt this point I believe the probability of significant military action against Iran in the next four years are better than 50 percent. If the Iranian regime is significantly destabilized/outright destroyed this will constitute in itself, regardless of whether regional chaos ensues as consequence or not, an imperialist act in the fullest sense of the term, i.e. an act of imperialist \"exemplary\" aggression against the entire world, in other words, a show of putting the entire world \"on notice\" (to quote Michael Flynn), that America's reach (i.e. intent) is now fully militarily totalitarian vis a vis the freedom of the world. An example of such a totalitarian aggression, is the entirely predictable/almost plannable destabilizing effect it would have on the European Union. Undoubtedly Cuba will also be on the regime's sights (for a \"regime\" it will be if it engages in such unqualifiedly aggressive hostilities). The divisive opposition of the phrases \"immigrants\" and \"working class whites\" is entirely in accord with the present stage of the Trump administration: the \"tyranny of appearances\"/\"despotism of forms.\" Trump is himself evidently tyrannized by this superficiality concerns, condition which is in turn mirrored or mimetized in the sadistic superficiality (equatable to an intoxicative oblivion) he seeks to inculcate or awaken in his most fervent followers and expanding from there throughout the wider society. This tyranny of appearances/despotism of forms seems to account for the exceedingly notable lack of minorities and women in the upper echelons of his administration: Trump either lacks the substance (the self-confidence) to scramble his most nativist followers' expectations by forming a more diverse cabinet and team (reflective of both the forms and substance of American society as a whole) or his own personal superficial prejudices are directly informing his decision in this respect (let us recall his pettiness and callousness of his attacks against the physical appearances of Cruz's wife and Carly Fiorina, among others, during the primary). This surface tyranny already plainly evident in the demographic restrictiveness of the highest and most visible parts of his administration seems quite correlative and reflective of his political decisions so far, the two are inextricable and reciprocal. This surface tyranny may eventually be seen as a foretaste of future unprecedented despotisms of substance, or it may simply be revealed to be an unintentional unmasking and revelation of the \"surface level\" reality previously covering the already existing despotisms of substance inherent and inextricable from the hidden imperial governing apparatus itself.

            "body": "Continued here.\n\n/u/damukobrakai\n\n&gt;opening a gateway in their minds\n\nBy which I take it you mean consciousness. \n\nSo you think people took drugs, then saw and heard things that others couldn't see. And instead of the logical \"Dude's tripping yo\", you're thinking \"Holy shit, 4th dimension and demons\". \n\nno. \n\n&gt; It certainly makes logical sense that religions can be based on encounters with spirits in different parts of the world. \n\nIf we were all polytheist like the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Natives, etc. Then maybe. Since there would be multiple spirits, and thus multiple gods. Your own logic here. \n\nHow do you get 1 god out of this?\n\n&gt;Fasting and prayer and accepting Jesus as your lord and savior are what bring you closer to God\n\nOnce again this is illogical. You said the only way to contact spirits would be to open a 4th dimensional portal in your mind while tripping. This is the only way since we cannot detect ***any*** sign of supernatural activity. \n\nHow the fuck does starving yourself, and talking/thinking to yourself fit in here?\n\n&gt;so I can see how those who didn't hear about the Bible or Jesus would end up worshipping a demon not knowing it was evil rather than good.\n\nAnd why are demons bad? Because drugs and sex is bad?\n\n&gt;It seems that God wants us to save eachother by spreading the word. \n\nWho are you to say what god would want?\n\nAlso, back stepping here. We have the Christian god, the one who believes that worshiping no other idols above him is worth putting on the 10 commandments, but rape isn't worth it. He wants you to never take his name in vein, to spread his word and always cherish him. Has forced many a bloody war on man kind in his name. \n\nMate, that sounds like a pride demon. \n\n&gt;A truly logical person wouldn't conclude that there is no God just because he hasn't seen proof personally.\n\nYet you'll say without a doubt that Odin, Thor, Loki, or their other counterparts, are not real? Why, you've never had experience personally?\n\n&gt; A logical person would admit his ignorance and draw no conclusion if there was no evidence of God that he can see.\n\nThe Christian god's infallible book has references to an impossible flood, a under 5000 year old earth, and many other provably wrong things. Could there be a god? Sure. But it ain't your god. \n\n&gt;Based on my experiences, I have come to the educated guess that Jesus is real.\n\nChange Jesus to Odin, Thor, blah blah blah, and suddenly you have someone just as devout as you, but you're both wrong in each others eyes, because neither of you can prove anything. \n\n&gt;But If God is real then I can't just twiddle my thumbs.\n\nWhy not? If god is real, and is the Christian god, he is all powerful, all knowing, and all loving. If god knows the future, then you cannot change it. \n\n&gt;It's a sign of intelligence to be able to entertain an idea without adopting it as your own.\n\nYeah, I've entertained it. doesn't mean it made any sense. \n\n&gt;I considered atheism and it doesn't explain all the evil in the world.\n\nOh perfect! The all loving, all powerful, all knwoing god explains it all!\n\nThere's evil because he doesn't know-, oh wait, lets try again.\n\nThere's evil because he can'- oh shit. One sec. \n\nThere's evil because God doesn't care- hmmm...\n\nThere's evil because it's his will for there to be evil because reasons. \n\nPerfect.\n\n&gt;Demons can possess us without us knowing.\n\nNo. They can't. Even if they were real, a sudden personality change would tip people off. Blacking out would tip people off. \n\nAlso, once again, the human mind is controlled by chemicals and electrons. Changing these changes minds. A demon would need to interact with you physically, or electrically, to do anything. Both are means we can use to detect them. \n\n&gt; What explanation does science have for animal cruelty\n\nOn Farms, many people will have stray cats. To deal with this problem, people will put them in a bag, and throw them in rivers. The nicer people hang it behind an exhaust pipe to kill them that way. This is population control. \n\nOn other parts of the world, Dogs and cats are food. This is their culture. \n\nAnimal Cruelty is a newer thing because out culture has humanized animals. What's the differance between cows and dogs? Cows will show you love and affection, yet are slaughtered for food. \n\n&gt;and endless wars\n\nA lot of wars are driven by Religion. \n\n&gt;Rothschild level wealth and greed?\n\nCapitalism. \n\n&gt;I don't believe humans are born that way.\n\nonce again, Nature Vs Nurture. \n\n&gt;You have to allow for the possibility that you are wrong and the consequences of rejecting your creator.\n\nThe all powerful god is unable to make a sinless world? Oh, wait, no I know this one. A talking snake gave humanity knowledge, and thus is evil. \n\nWeird isn't it, Satan given humans knowledge and [kills a lot less](https://www.quora.com/According-to-the-Bible-who-killed-more-people-Satan-or-God). But is the bad guy? \n\n&gt;If there is only the tangible scientifically measurable world that's real in your eyes than why does rape fuck people up for life?\n\nBecause of PTSD? Why does god allow rape? \n\n&gt;Regular sex won't but forced sex-even if no physical beating is involved- will drive people to suicidal feelings.\n\nBecause it's against their wishes? \n\n&gt;Yes maybe they just had a chemical reaction or perhaps it was purely emotional.\n\nThose 'chemical reactions' are emotions. \n\n&gt;But now your entering non scientific territory.\n\nNo scientist has ever said emotions don't exist...?\n\n&gt;There's no rape pill to restore someone's peace of mind.\n\nThere's also no pill to regrow an arm? \n\n&gt;There's a one size fits all depression pill.\n\nTo an extent. Antidepressants help balance neural transmitters in the brain. Memories are more than just the transmitters, but rather physical connections between neurons. \n\n&gt;No tests to measure depression and what caused it. Only theories. \"Did someone die recently? Did you lose your job? Get divorced? Molested as a child? Yeah? Oh that's probably the cause.\n\nThose questions are the tests? Finding out what happened to them will help them move forwards. And not do what happened to them on others. \n\n&gt; depression is a symptom rather than the root of a problem.\n\nDepression is a problem that causes more problems. \n\n&gt;Anxiety and depression can have a physical or psychological cause and the number of causes can be endless.\n\n...yes? And?\n\n&gt;They can take your money even if the cause is biological and only treatable through change of diet. \n\nWhat kind of rantings are you on about here? You don't have to go if you don't want to. Repeated visits are for your own benefit. \n\n&gt;But maybe the real harm from rape is spiritual.\n\nno.\n\n&gt; Maybe there was an exchange of energy.\n\nThis would be measured by science shit mate. \n\n&gt;Maybe love fills us with life energy but violence drains us.\n\nLook at both world wars. If violence drained people, and love filled them, The military wouldn't have had female soldiers banned. \n\n&gt;Maybe a demon is conjured or attaches to the victim.\n\nor maybe they feel unsafe, not wanting a bad thing to happen again. \n\n&gt;That would explain decades of misery that follows child molestation. \n\nOr the fact that they feel like they cannot trust people.\n\nOr they dislike getting close to people. \n\nOr that they feel uncomfortable around others. \n\nYou know, something that makes sense. \n\n&gt;You don't know which is true or false.\n\nMaking up demons instead of following centuries of science falls under Occam's Razor. There's no proof what so ever for your ideas, and a lot for mine. \n\n&gt;Scientifically speaking, it would make more evolutionary sense for people to shrug off rape so they can get on with their lives.\n\nScientifically speaking, it would have made more sense for the body to redesign the eye when the first water creatures became land creatures. Instead, we just keep it wet all the time. \n\nScientifically speaking, the female vagina should have teeth to protect it from unwanted penetrations. \n\nEvolution doesn't work with foresight. It works by random chance. \n\n&gt; Especially if it's not permantly damaging physically.\n\nmemories are physical within the brain. Muscle memory is a thing, as the more you do something, the more you remember it, the easier it is to re-do. \n\n&gt; But I believe there is a change in energy. An indelible mark on the soul.\n\nSucks you're wrong though. Have no proof, and a massive inability to have any kind of proof. ",

In response without hisitation or ego he said, \"Yes\".\n\nI then asked him if he was a lizard person and i asked him if he was a lizard person would he have to admit it. Again without hesitation he said, \"Yes\". I then proceeded to ask if he was a lizard person and he very a matter of factly said, \"Yes\"\n\nHe then went on to tell me that another one of our co-workers was a lizard person as well. I didn't make this connection at the time but I did once I did some research. Supposedly lizard people are predominantly redheads and both of them were gingers.\n\nNow i too am a redhead so i am definitely not saying all redheads are lizard people. \n\nSomething that also stood out to me was in his refrigerator he had a pitcher of tap water. On the pitcher he had skull and crossbones picture with fluoride written underneath it. Why would anyone keep something like that in their refrigerator? \n\nNow lizard people aren't lizards with human skin on or some sort of force field projector showing human form. They are beings From a \"higher 4th negative\" Dimension who have materialize themselves into the human form. They aren't all necessarily in positions of power either. Their sole purpose is to keep as many of us reincarnating into this dimension. \n\nWe are spiritual beings locked into a physical form but to them we are food.\n\nDon't believe what David Icke has said about them using some sort of technology to keep us here.

            "body": "&gt; Isn\u2019t lack of oxygen a moot point in the dimension where the white light exists?\n\nIt is kind of a cop out being that it's a know occurrence when you lack O2. But I toss it out so I don't get brushed off by skeptics cause I'm still partially skeptical of the whole thing myself (and the majority of my peers as skeptics. As for needing to breath while I was in the light I, don't remember. At the least I wasn't paying attention to my breathing.\n\n&gt; Pretty neat. Do you/did you recognize the women?\n\nNot at all. To this day I wonder. My mom believes it's my grandmother on her side of the family that didn't live to see my birth. She was so bright that I couldn't see really anything other than her outline and her hand reaching out. She seemed to be wearing some type of robe but again it was just an outline basked in light.\n\n&gt; Fucking scary\u2026but very fascinating all the same actually.\n\nIt was terrifying to say the least. Right when I was about to pass out from being under so long I popped up on the surface. I was also in a foreign country at the time. When I arrived at the surface I started calling for help the best I could but in the wrong language. No one came to help. People did start to scream and run from the water so I've always assumed they thought I was screaming shark which scared me. I didn't know if they were actually running from a shark or me screaming thinking I was under attack from one(I was around 11 years old). It made it all that much more worse. I had to swim back in alone crying and gasping for air. \n\n&gt; O_o Jesus. Dude, stay inside. You\u2019re a walking accident. lol.\n\nRight? I'm glad I didn't join the military or some other dangerous endeavor. These are the three that had some type of possible spiritual meaning to them. I have a few other near death story's I could tell but I didn't see or feel anything outside what I was experiencing in the moment. If I had the experiences every time I would probably lean more in either direction of the scale. One side being its natural(brain or psychosis) and the other being it's all real.\n\n&gt; Well that\u2019s cuz you woke up, bro. You didn\u2019t stay in the white light. I\u2019ve read that the process is kind of different for many. Some get \u201cwiped\u201d the second they go in. Others meet with \u201cguardians\u201d or whatnot and have some \u201crelax/down time\u201d for a while before getting wiped and reincarnating again.\n\nI see what your saying. More like I got a glance from afar. Makes sense. Once I took her hand I immediately woke up. Could have been a guardian turning me around in line. \n\n&gt; As I already mentioned in this OP, read the works of Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross, Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Ian Stevenson (Dr. Eben Alexander).\n\nOn it thank you!\n\n&gt; The continuance of personal identity exists entirely independent of church or religion.\n\nMakes sense.\n\n&gt; So wait a minute\u2026If you say this, then how can you say:\n\nThis is my skeptical brain at work. To see and hear things in this reality is one thing but to have them in say a dream state or near death experience leaves room for the easily explainable. I'm kind of one of those \"have to see it to believe it\" types. But as you can tell I'm still open to suggestion.\n\n&gt; Are you saying that personal identity exists, but a white light isn\u2019t at all a necessary experience after crossing over? If so, then I understand and wouldn\u2019t disagree with that. If you\u2019re not saying that, however, please explain.\n\nMore along the lines of the white light and my experiences may have just been mere hormones and brain chemicals on over drive. First time being a high fever. The second nearly drowning and the third almost going over a cliff.\n\nTo put it bluntly if I was certifiably dead tomorrow and was standing over my corpse in the morgue I would probably question whether I was actually dead. I'd most likely be standing there trying to make \"logical\"(scientific) sense of it all. I figure my lack of a religious upbringing leaves me questioning more than going on faith with this matter.\n\nFor me to 100% believe my own experiences I'd need to be fully aware and not under any type of stress. Example would be while sitting here answering your questions a bright light starts to form. I'd need it to happen in this reality if you know what I'm saying. The only reason I can say I believe in paranormal activity what ever they may be is because my experiences were not under duress. That and 4 other dudes plus guests every day for almost a year all saw, heard, smelled the same things. \n\nEdit: If it matters I've never experienced lucid dreaming. ",

In which case the entire theory falls apart, non-sexual traumas being far more common within families and being similarly causative of dysfunctions that some amateur researchers exclusively ascribe to childhood sexual psychological traumatisms. In which case the sexual dimension to a trauma (re-)manifesting later in life would be entirely secondary and epiphenomenal, i.e. a relatively unremarkable development in an adult's reaction to the stresses caused by subconsciously active non-sexual childhood trauma.",

            "body": "The Mandela Effect doesn't propose that people are rewriting history. It claims that the theorised multi-verse is real. In addition, the lines between those multiple but almost identical universes has become blurred.    \nAt some point, and some claim CERN/LHC to be responsible, individual consciousnesses have been slipping from one almost identical universe to another.    \nIn one universe/reality, Darth Vader said \"Luke, I am your father\". Here and now, he has always said \"No, I am your father\".  \nSimilarly, in one universe C3PO was always completely gold in colour. In this universe, the lower half of one leg is silver.   \nIn one reality, they were called the Berenstein Bears. In another it's Berenstain.  \nThere are thousands of example of this. Mandela's 'remembered' death in the 90's being the one that started this.       \n\nDon't misunderstand though. This is not simply a rewriting of history. Even when accessing original non-digital media, evidence of events that people are 100% certain took place can no longer be found.    \nPeople look for proof of what they were positive did exist. But it cannot be found because those people are now existing in a dimension/reality/universe where those things never happened.       \n\nPersonally, I have an unshakeable belief that Dolly from Moonraker had braces on her teeth. Which is why she and Jaws had the connection they did. But in this reality, they do not exist. Even on original 40-year old VHS tapes she has no braces. The actress who played the role has been asked and she, from this reality, said there were never any braces. But thousands of people are totally convinced that the Dolly wore braces in the movie they have seen countless times.     \n\nWhether you think dimensional shifting is possible or that this is evidence of mass delusion is up to you. But this is what the Mandela Effect proposes to be true. ",

I don't even want to think what else .. no need to call for people's guns because no need to call martial law because it will already be martial law under the guise of a national emergency or communicable diseases. \n\nDepopulation is the plan weeding out the people they see  as unfit or unwilling to serve them ......this has been set up for a long time.. there are light years ahead of us with technology and everything, they can do anything they're just keeping people in the dark .....And all the corporations and Elon Musk and Google Apple and others are in on it..

            "body": "  \u201cBefore the incorporation of essence, so to speak, there were elements of consciousness. You may also term these to be \u2018units,\u2019 which others have expressed previously. (1) These elements of consciousness know no limits of time or space. You may think of these as very tiny black holes. You may think of them, if you will, in physical terms as elements smaller than your smallest physical particles; but these elements are that which create all physical expression. Everything within every universe within every dimension is created by these elements of consciousness, and they are everything. They are not only the driving force behind matter and action, but are matter and action also;\n\n\u201cLet us view the workings of consciousness \u2013 what IS consciousness \u2013 and the distinctions of essence and consciousness. You may notice throughout this information that I express a distinction between essence and consciousness. Essence is consciousness, but there is consciousness that is not essence. Essence is also unlimited. This be the area that is very difficult for your understanding within physical focus, for you are so very accustomed to thinking in singular terms. All that you create within your physical dimension moves in this direction.\n\n\u201cYou create things. You identify things. Even things that you may not see you classify as things, and this creates great difficulty within your thinking and your imagining of how there may be an element that is not a thing and that may be some quality in itself but unbounded simultaneously, that may be thought of in the manner of a distinction but not separate....\n\n\u201cIn this, I have spoken previously of links of consciousness. Links of consciousness are not things either. They are elements of consciousness, but they hold no form. They are not within what you term to be a time framework, although they may be inserted into a time framework, but the time framework itself is comprised of links of consciousness, and these links of consciousness have no necessary space arrangement. They exist within all space arrangements simultaneously and within all time frameworks simultaneously.\n\n\u201cNow; links of consciousness may group together, and in specific types of groupings together create a tone, and they may choose collectively to be creating in conjunction with that tone what may be identified as personality. The personality is a specific organization of movement within a vibrational quality of a collective expression of these links of consciousness, which in this type of configuration is creating what we term to be essence.\n\n\u201cEssence is not separate and apart from consciousness. There is no separate and apart from consciousness. There is no boundary to consciousness. There is no limit to consciousness. Therefore, there is no thing, no element, no action outside of consciousness, for there is no outside.- Within consciousness, the configuration of these links of consciousness creating personality tone is the designation of essence.\n\n\u201cThese configurations are not separate and apart from each other, for be remembering that I have expressed to you, each link of consciousness occupies all space arrangements and all time frameworks and all of consciousness. Therefore, one link of consciousness may be an element that is within the configuration or grouping that comprises itself to be creating of your essence, and simultaneously, that same link of consciousness occupies all other essences.\u201d\n\n[Links](http://www.eliasforum.org/digests/links.html)",

It really is mind boggling when you scratch your neurons together. Is it really just a group of people in a secret society(ies) controling the world for the past however many thousands of years? \n\nOne day 5000 years ago did some friends come together and say, \"Hey you know we have a lot of knowledge about the world, our bloodlines can take it over eventually and hoard all the information about the universe and our reality, what do you guys say?\"\n\nHave we actually been controlled by reptilians from the lower 4th dimension? (Seriously, why do so many people discredit this? You don't even know what a fucking black hole is, how do you know there aren't beings in other dimensions controlling us? I totally get people shitting on this theory, but fuck it really is annoying that people don't try to give ANY thought towards more \"crazy\" theories...they are engineered this way though!)\n\nAre the Greys controlling us? Other aliens? Is it Anunnaki from Nibiru who genetically created Humans to be their slave race such as Zacheria Sitchen claims? Or are we just in a simulation, and the elites figured this out? Are we vastly powerful spiritual beings experiencing a life in the third dimension, have always been and always will be? Or do we just zonk out into blackness and the non-existent when we die? Why would the elites give a fuck to do all of this? So they can live their measly 90 years on Earth kind of ruling it from behind the veil? So their kids can rule it? Honestly, it makes me think there is more to life, after death, and all that because of everything they are doing. Do they really value their offspring that much to try to make them the rulers of the world? I mean 100 years ago the elites didn't totally rule the planet, and today they don't. They don't have their one world government, one religion yet. So why do it, for their kids some day, or their kids kids? Or do they know something, do they know they'll be around after this life? \n\nAre the royal bloodlines ruling us made up of the same DNA that we are, they just figured out how to rule the planet long ago and have been working on it ever since? When was that, Roman times? \n\nWhat kind of knowledge are they hoarding? Do these satanic rituals really work? Is it simply just tradition, or is there real purpose? If there is real purpose, that means there is some kind of force the general public does not know about. Is it spiritual, magic, who the fuck knows but it sure isn't in our realm of knowledge if there really is something about it. \n\nWhat is their end goal...everyone says its to kill off 99% of the worlds population right? Is that after they use us to build their infrastructure, or what? Is it to build up technology until they literally live like gods forever? True immortality? We know they are soft-killing us, AIDS, cancer, vaccines, wars, H1N1, etc..idk. Too many thoughts for this evening!",

As in, yes it has gone on since before 0 AD but by referencing 0 AD I'm essentially referring to 'since the the dawn of time, recorded history' - There was nothing magical that happened at 0 AD to make it worse ;)\n\nSwitzerland is far, far more significant than the rest. I reference that one above all others because that's where it is strongest, and it is likewise where the 'kings' put their children in order to be safe. In the other cities, you might have a few thousand 'in on it', where as in Switzerland you have hundreds of thousands playing the game. - However your observation that all 'city states' are essentially the models for corruption (hong kong, Singapore) is correct.\n\nI could understand a system in which the devil is perceived as a '4th dimensional being'. Essentially truth, reason, knowledge are a 4th dimension, as it is unaltered by time. However, I find it harder to understand a concept in which these 'evil spirits' have an ability to directly interfere with our reality.\n\nFor example, could a 'great spirit' come down and bring enlightenment to all the world? I don't think so. As far as I'm concerned, it must be learned, but I could be wrong.\n\nIt would be funny, and not terribly unsurprising if life on earth was originally seeded by aliens. I've thought about how to best 'populate the galaxy', and I believe the best course would be to send microbes to essentially every planet in the universe, rather than sending adult men there to build civilizations. Through such a way, in the infinite expanse of time, diverse life would continue, without significant cost to the living.\n\nBut I disagree with the notion that 'chaos' and 'enlightenment' are actual beings (even in the 4th dimension) that in some way affect ourselves. Maybe, but I find that more 'superstitious' so to speak. Or rather, that is akin to the final notion in 'the men in black' where there are a series of marbles representing the universes, and so on.\n\nConcepts like that are worth thinking about, but ascribing them as 'evil spirits' and so forth would throw a person off track. If they exist, they are unable to affect our reality, as far as I can tell.",

            "body": "You're spouting a theory.  Not proven logical truths.  Atheism isn't proven.  It's a religion like any other.  One that worships science and technology rather than God or demons.  You'd sooner believe in aliens than demons because that's more \"scientific\".  It really isn't. Not that it matters. Half of the scientific facts/truths get proven false within ten years.  How many horror stories can you think of off the top of your head resulting from health authorities misleading us?  Cocaine was in coca cola.  Smoking wasn't considered unhealthy.  Ulcers were thought to be caused by stress.  They were dead wrong and they caused millions to die prematurely. It's all a guessing game.  We don't even understand the human brain.  Science hasn't debunked the theory that the Supernatural exists-or that God exists.  It simply can't measure or test it yet.  We haven't fully understood the third dimension much less the fourth.you say the Bible has been corrupted and can't be trusted because men have edited it.  You think scientific information doesn't get manipulated and corrupted? You think the science driven medical industry put our needs before profits?  You think the media doesn't lie? You put a lot of faith in science.  And in man. \n  \n\n\"Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.\"-wiki     \nBuilding knowledge.  Not all knowing.  Not building truths. Knowledge can be true or false.    \n\"If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you're mis-informed.\"-Mark Twain     \nJust Interpretations of reality. Just finding more peices of a puzzle that keeps getting bigger.  Every answered questions leads to 5 new questions. \n\n\nYour argument works both ways. Your knowledge is given to you by a media that is monopolized by corporations with political agendas. You're information is tampered with just as you claim the Bible is.  You don't know what the camera is capturing when you see orbs flying in them.   Your guessing.  You don't know whether that reptilian face is real or not.  You are assuming based on your past experiences. You're think you're using occalms razor to identify the the truth by removing all assumptions. But you don't remove your own assumptions. Others have had supernatural experiences.  Who are you to conclude that they are all wrong and you are right?  Its hypocritical to claim it's not ok  for me to think I'm right and everyone disagreeing is wrong when you are just as guilty of it. You want me to prove God exists?  Why don't you prove to me that He doesn't? Giving a popular opinion isn't the same thing as logical proof. The fact that millions of people are atheists proves nothing as far as whether God exists.  Especially when the media is obviously pushing that idea hard.  Everyone knows atheism is cool and Christianity isn't. If I'm correct in that the world is run by closet satanists, than it makes sense that the media would push the satanic agenda which is to get people to be atheist or straight up satanist.\n \nYou don't know that sleep paralysis is merely a natural biological response that only appears external as an illusion.  You just heard that is the current scientific position on the topic.  But you can't replicate sleep paralysis dreams as an experiment.  You can't study something that can't be replicated in experiments so it's just a theory.  Most of science and medicine is about makeshift labels and categories that are ever changing.  When I studied science at oxford university my tutors expressed disappointlment in the mainstream rejection of anything that involved the unmeasurable and unreplicatable.  The unexplainable is ignored and discounted.  They don't bother with it.  They don't have a way to measure or understand it yet.  That doesn't mean people don't encounter spirits.  It just means we don't have ways to capture them and study them like the topics that science normally studies.   meanwhile all the predictions in the Bible are accurate so far.  I can't even assume that about tomorrow's weather forecast.  It's frequently wrong In spite of it being rooted in science.      \n\nPsychologists and chiropractors aren't able to measure and replicate results like the sciences but you probably think those are valid.  They aren't anymore so than the study of supernatural phenomena. It's all intangible. Psychology is just a series of \"schools of thought\" aka theories.  Many contradict eachother. They are trying to gain acceptance in scientific circles by moving away from the things that can't tangibly be replicated in an experiment and they are making a mistake.  They want to acknowledge the connection between mind and body since it is becoming clear that the two are inseparable.  They both factor in to what creates feelings.  They used to treat them as separate and they were just as wrong to do that as they are now in moving away from the spiritual side of things. They don't have answers, just theories.  It's not like science has debunked the God theory.  It just won't endorse it due to lack of tangible evidence in the third dimension.  We are all just cavemen making assumptions based on the shadows we see through the pinhole view we each have of reality. \n\nI've studied world religions for decades.      My theory about world religions- a class I aced in college -yay -along with logic class) is that most of these religions are started as encounters with demons.  They are easily conjured by sex acts and taking drugs among endless other ways including meditation and yoga.  It's highly plausible that- for instance- Indians took peyote and were able to contact the fourth dimension suddenly by opening a gateway in their minds and encountered demons and assumed that they were Gods due to their supernatural powers.  It certainly makes logical sense that religions can be based on encounters with spirits in different parts of the world.  Fasting and prayer and accepting Jesus as your lord and savior are what bring you closer to God so I can see how those who didn't hear about the Bible or Jesus would end up worshipping a demon not knowing it was evil rather than good.  It seems that God wants us to save eachother by spreading the word.  This is just where I am in my personal journey. I have researched and questions all religions including my own and this is the conclusion I have come to so far in my 34 years of existence. \n\nA truly logical person wouldn't conclude that there is no God just because he hasn't seen proof personally. 'If Bond4141 doesn't believe in God then God does not exist ' is not a valid statement because of the false assumption that you are all knowing.  A logical person would admit his ignorance and draw no conclusion if there was no evidence of God that he can see.  Based on my experiences, I have come to the educated guess that Jesus is real.  I'm open to the possibility that I am wrong just as I'm open to the possibility that you are a figment of my imagination.  \n\nBut If God is real then I can't just twiddle my thumbs.  He has strict orders for us.  It's a sign of intelligence to be able to entertain an idea without adopting it as your own.  I considered atheism and it doesn't explain all the evil in the world.  Demons do. Demons can possess us without us knowing.  They can drag us down or lead us to harm others.  What explanation does science have for animal cruelty and endless wars and Rothschild level wealth and greed? I don't believe humans are born that way.  I think we are in a war between good and evil.  There is a battle being waged for our souls. There are good spirits and there are evil ones.  You have to allow for the possibility that you are wrong and think about the consequences of rejecting your creator.      \n\nIf there is only the tangible scientifically measurable world that's real in your eyes than why does rape fuck people up for life? Regular sex won't but forced sex-even if no physical beating is involved- will drive people to suicidal feelings.  Why is that?  Yes maybe they just had a chemical reaction or perhaps it was purely emotional. But now your entering non scientific territory. There's no rape pill to restore someone's peace of mind.  There's a one size fits all depression pill.  There's no burden of proof on the part of the psychologist. No tests to measure depression and what caused it.  Only theories. \"Did someone die recently?  Did you lose your job? Get divorced?  Molested as a child? Yeah?  Oh that's probably the cause.  Let's talk about it for a few years until you no longer feel anxious or depressed for any reason. Or until you go broke. \" \ndepression is a symptom rather than the root of a problem.   Anxiety and depression can have a physical or psychological cause and the number of causes can be endless.  This is why psychology is the perfect business model.  They can take your money even if the cause is biological and only treatable through change of diet. They don't even have to rule out biological causes before they diagnose you and start handing you pills.    But maybe the real harm from rape is spiritual rather than physical or mental.  Maybe there was an exchange of energy.  Maybe love fills us with life energy but violence drains us. Maybe depression is nothing more than a soul drained of it's energy by an evil spirit. Maybe a demon is conjured by the violence or attaches to the victim jumping from the possessed person.  That would explain decades of misery that follows child molestation.  You don't know which is true or false.  Scientifically speaking, it would make more evolutionary sense for people to shrug off rape so they can get on with their lives.  Especially if it's not permantly damaging physically.  But I believe there is a change in energy.  An indelible mark on the soul.\n\nThank God that \"Thou shalt be concise\" isn't one of the commandments.\n\nTL; DR:  That's just like, your opinion, man.",

Trump has since the primaries evinced extremely strong sadistic tendencies; this is likely a personal preference and appetite on his part, but it also functions as a demagogic whetting or instruction in psycho-political sadism (inherent in oligarchic fascism), i.e. in the promotion, legitimization, intensification, and popularization of tendencies equivalent to sadism and Sadean personality traits in preparation for an initiation of open hostilities (though, at least initially, short of outright war) against significant nations and economic blocs of the world (Mexico, Middle East, China, EU) and against important, yet ostensibly foreign-like, demographic sectors within the U.S.: African Americans, Latinos, Muslims, Native Americans, even the \u201cunreliable\u201d majority of women concerned with equitable reproductive health access, etc.\nNationally, the logic of such a \u201cpolitical sadism\u201d would be in perfect complementarity with the international version: generalize the most divisive ethos short of actual militarized (dictatorially oppressive) action through full spectrum utilization of media in the service of an oligarchy that feels itself receding from relative and absolute power in a world ever more immersed in freely globalized trade (to reiterate, to the relative detriment of American hegemonic political and economic power). Trump, standard bearer for an oligarchy opportunistically directly stepping \u201cforward to the plate,\u201d promises millions of industrial sector jobs in a newly, if principally industrially, autarkic U.S. Maybe he will deliver in the mid to long term on this promise, in the immediate to short term his \u201cachievements\u201d will be essentially denagatory , denialist, negative, censorious: civic/humanitarian prohibitions, restrictions, dis-protections in the name of greater national security and policial exigencies; per oligarchic rationalizing protocol, best that the populace become ever more inured and desensitized to such civic and societal (oligarchically optative) harshness by being imbued in the \u201cmodelic\u201d sadism of a personally autarkic-hyper-capitalist cult leader figure (the effective opposite of Clinton\u2019s \u201cStronger Together\u201d): a sort of antipodal dimension Chairmen Mao of capitalist autarky (whose vision is to export, impose, and disseminate the same discoherent ideology throughout the world and have the U.S. be the isolationist leader of an isolationized world).\n",

Sure square, triangle, but circle? Damn circle gets us every time. We use pi which is irrational and henceforth every measurement of a curve is therefore estimated and our entire framework is therefore thrown off. \n\nUnderstanding that the universe, the earth, and the even a basketball change volume and shape throughout time does this mean we need to calculate a fourth dimension when calculating volume and circumference of curves? You touched upon it on my question of love stating the earth has no shape and we live in our pineal gland of DMT wash but we should be able to measure circles! Unless there are no such thing as circles and we live in a strictly polygon world that our eyes deceive us from but Is there a way to accurately measure circles on this planet or any planet?  Sorry I'm only asking the tough questions.",

I saw it twice in translated Russian literature on\nparanormal activity and psychic phenomenon that the word \u201cpsychotic\u201d used accidentally\nin place of \u201cpsychic\u201d. Also overly stimulated minds exhibit strong electrical signals and\nare easier to spot as well as piggy back the current electrical brain signals with others, i.e.\nneurotransmitter modulations. Intellectuals and schizophrenics exhibit increase electrical\nbrain activity. The other condition that determines this slang use of the word \u201cpsychic\u201d is\nthe disability of the subject to be easily hypnotized. Or in other words their brains entrain\nto external stimuli quickly.\n\nbtw I meditated *too much* and saw another dimension and talked/researched about aliens a lot online so they target me ;) they hurt me *really bad* whenever I meditate. I believe there is an esoteric side to the targeting as well and aliens are involved. oooo I know you don't like to hear that. \n\nedit: there could be other reasons to my targeting I only included what was relevant to your comment ",

            "body": "&gt; I could sit here and explain it all scientifically. Such as lack of oxygen etc.\n\nIsn\u2019t lack of oxygen a moot point in the dimension where the white light exists?\n\n&gt; The first time I was a child with a deadly high fever. I saw the light and a illuminated women within it. She stretched out her hand and I took it. I woke up the next morning without a fever. Family still talks about it.\n\nPretty neat.  Do you/did you recognize the women?\n\n&gt; Almost a decade later I nearly drowned in a undertow while swimming in the ocean. I was pulled to the bottom and was being hurtled across the coral. Again I saw the light, felt the same presence and blamo I open my eyes and I'm on the surface and safely made it to shore.\n\nFucking scary\u2026but very fascinating all the same actually.\n\n&gt; Again almost a decade later while off trail skiing with friends 4 of us took a cut through some trees while bombing and we ended up nearly flying off a 100-200 foot cliff. The first 30 feet was at about a 45 degree angle. All of us hit or landed on something. One hit a tree before going off the edge. Another happened to land on the only flat spot and me and the last guy were both able to stop by grabbing onto downed trees. I literally had my ankles hanging off the edge of the cliff looking over the top of all the tree's below. No light but the same feelings of being over watched and guided to a \"safe\" passage.\n\nO_o  Jesus.  Dude, *stay inside*.  You\u2019re a walking accident. lol.\n\nKidding, of course.\n\n&gt; And for whats it worth the one time I chose to go to the light I woke up with my memory's and I was still in this body.\n\nWell that\u2019s cuz *you woke up*, bro.  You didn\u2019t *stay* in the white light.  I\u2019ve read that the process is kind of different for many.  Some get \u201cwiped\u201d the second they go in.  Others meet with \u201cguardians\u201d or whatnot and have some \u201crelax/down time\u201d for a while before getting wiped and reincarnating again.\n\n&gt; I'm very open minded so even with all these experiences I still doubt the validity of there even being a \"light\" that's not just natural brain chemistry during a traumatic event.\n\nAs I already mentioned in this OP, read the works of Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross, Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Ian Stevenson (Dr. Eben Alexander).  They\u2019ve all done research on a multitude of subjects (or in Dr. Alexander\u2019s case, experienced the phenomenon first hand themselves) and have all described occurrences where the subject is able to verify things that were going on around them while they were considered \u201cofficially medically dead\u201d.  That simply cannot happen unless personal identity exists independent of the physical body.\n\n&gt; As far as my family can remember we have always been \"over watched\" by angels. Which is odd since no one in the last 3 generations has gone to church.\n\nThe continuance of personal identity exists entirely independent of church or religion.\n\n&gt; I do believe in ghosts after living in a haunted house with 4 others guys in college.\n\nSo wait a minute\u2026If you say this, then how can you say:\n\n&gt; I still doubt the validity of there even being a \"light\" that's not just natural brain chemistry during a traumatic event.\n\nAre you saying that personal identity exists, but a white light isn\u2019t at all a necessary experience after crossing over?  If so, then I understand and wouldn\u2019t disagree with that.  If you\u2019re *not* saying that, however, please explain.\n\nThanks for your response, by the way.\n\nVery fascinating stuff for sure.  Cheers,",

Mitchell says the benevolent ETs won't let world war erupt, but the planet has freewill and we have to reach critical mass in consciousness as a species in order for first contact to occur and for us to join the galactic federation, which we were cut off from in order to conduct the luciferian experiment.\n\nhttp://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/ufos_nuclear_missiles_warheads_shutdown\n\nhttp://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/11/10/why-are-ufos-shutting-down-our-nuclear-missiles/\n\nthere have been energy portals on the planet that were dormant from atlantean and lemurian times and they have been slowly being activated, like the 1/1/01, 2/2/02, 3/3/03...12/12/12 dates that the crystals were activated on the crystalline and pyramid system energy grid, the sun is also a stargate and there have been energy waves beaming through in the form of solar weather that are slowly reminding people who they are as the luciferian experiment comes to an end on this planet/plane/dimension/space-time continuum...\n\nthere has to be an ending in order for the new system and civilization to be put into place and the hope is that everything can end peacefully with little bloodshed.  i am willing to forgive the elite if they are removed from power and kept from doing this again.  they played their roles perfectly in the experiment.",

A person who spends 3 'earth years' circling a black hole will age 1 year, due to the forces of gravity, and so on. Likewise, matter within a black hole is seemingly 'everywhere and no where', or rather it is 'sucked it' at a rate in excess of the speed of light.\n\nSo yes, you are right, but not in the sense in which it can be measured with a watch.

Which I always thought was clever given the title of the show: \"Ya dude, this show is trippy. Wanna know something even trippier tho...? 'STRANGER THINGS' have actually happened in *real life!* Check it out, go to the wikipedia page for MK Ultra.\"\n\nIf persuading people into being interested in this stuff is the game, what a masterful chess move by the creators to let all knowledge-levels participate and play their role (i.e. the newbie drawn in by the show/cinematography/soundtrack; and the conspiracy population sitting right next to the newbie to guide his future research).\n\nThen again, I am in no way positive on any of that; just theories that make sense for now. :)\n\nspez: also, if you love horror/thriller movies and want to explore the alternate dimension concept you mentioned, I highly highly recommend Banshee Chapter. Not sure if its on netlfix anymore but definitely worth the watch. Super unsettling tho, in case you're not into that.",

            "body": "A lot of people seem to skip over the 4th dimension when discussing this and I'm not sure why.\n\nIs it because we percieve time as our fourth dimension? We have our 3d space, and then time as the 4th. I feel like that is looking at it from too mathematical a point of view. Time doesn't exist and we only percieve it linearly. I think time/space is built into everything, not just our dimension. We percieve things this way because we are in the 3rd density, ie. the only dimension with actual physical space where you can \"touch\" things, which makes this dimension unique in terms of gaining life experience and evolving your soul consciousness. Dimensions are more like a rainbow or the musical scale imo, so why suddenly jump from 3rd to 5th?\n\nedit: also, just adding that I didn't mean for this come off like I was putting your point down, and didn't mean for it to seem like I took an issue with it. Just curious in regards to this topic because I see some people reference 4th as our next step, and others jump to 5.",

            "body": "**Do you believe the victims of neuroweapons, or do you deny their holocaust?**\n\nPS. you say 9 million Jews in Europe. If you take 1 million holocaust survivors in 2002, use actuarial tables, you get 15 million survivors at end of ww2. Add to that the supposed 6 million figure you get 21 million. So even without adding those Jews that emmigrated, you're way over the 9 million.\n\nYou say it's impossible for large numbers of people to lie. And yet for hundreds of years the lie of blood libel, witchcraft etc. persisted. In fact, we have a Jew, Alan Sabrosky, who says that Israel did 911. To account for the success of the operation and keeping the truth suppressed, this Jew estimates half of US Jews are traitors.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIka141BKjw\n\nWe know how this could be possible - Jewish laws that are similar to mafia rules, don't testify against other Jews, it's okay to break agreements with non Jews.\n\n&gt;somehow the rumor took hold that this means that it was made from Jewish fat.\n\nThere was a Jewish guy who showed people soap and said the nazis made it. The official story is that he hoaxed by the naughty nazis. \n\nYou know they found a lampshade made out of human skin which genetic tests showed was Jewish? If its just a \"rumours paranoia\", who made this lampshade?\n\n&gt;And whose \"job\" was it to \"lie to the enemy\" \n\nAnyone working in propaganda departments, psychological warfare departments. It's their job to deceive and lie about the enemy,\n\n&gt; This mythical monolithic Jew hivemind you've invented? \n\nYour words not mine. This Jewish rabbi insists Jews are aliens receiving instructions on taking over the world from another dimension:\n\n*So from this entire planet, we are aliens coming from a different galaxy. We receive this ray of light \u2013 this awakening \u2013 individually. And now we\u2019re gathering as groups starting to prep ourselves to conquer Earth. That\u2019s the mission.*\n\n*Question from the audience: How do we conquer it?*\n\n*Rav Michael Laitman: How do we conquer it? We\u2019re also sent the method. We\u2019re being shown everything gradually. We\u2019re being taught. Not being taught, but kind of trained and activated\u2026 which sets our minds in motion. But in fact, it\u2019s coming from our original planet. And thanks to that original natural force we have, we will take over those living on Earth.*\n\n*Why are you looking at me like that? You don\u2019t believe me? I\u2019m telling you seriously! It\u2019s even more than that. It\u2019s not a different galaxy \u2013 it\u2019s a different universe. It\u2019s a different dimension altogether. That\u2019s who we are\u2026*\n\nSeems pretty wacky to me, but I guess they've got to tell their followers *something* to distract them from all the pedophilia. ",

            "body": "&gt; You're spouting a theory\n\nTo add to this, The idea the earth revolves around the sun is a Theory, the Heliocentric Theory. Even Gravity is just a Theory. \n\nIn science a Theory is the working model of what has been observed. \n\n&gt;Not proven logical truths.\n\nNo, but once again it's a combination of multiple truths. The universe is 13 billion years old. The earth 4.5 Billion. Humans are ~200 000 years old. Then there's the actual debunking. Noah's ark never happened, there is no evidence for a large flood. Even if there was, the concept is overly flawed. Evolution is a proven fact, animals come from like animals in the past. The only real debate is how animals get 'selected'. \n\n&gt;It's a religion like any other.\n\nA religion requires faith. Faith takes a 'truth' and finds evidence to fit it. Atheism doesn't follow that. Atheism looks at what is, and fills the truth in from that.\n\n&gt;One that worships science and technology\n\nNothing is worshiped. Atheists don't go to Museums every Sunday to sing science songs. \n\n&gt;You'd sooner believe in aliens than demons because that's more \"scientific\".\n\nYes, the universe is infinite. It's more likely that life exists elsewhere than just Earth. \n\nDemons however are presumed to exist on earth. Yet we have no tangible proof that they exist. \n\n&gt;Half of the scientific facts/truths get proven false within ten years.\n\nYes? Once again, Science looks at what is and gets ideas from that. While ago exo-planets were assumed rare, now we know they're common. Science is constantly getting changed to reflect new findings. Religion is not. Would you rather follow 2000 year old stories, or what we can prove today?\n\n&gt;How many horror stories can you think of off the top of your head resulting from health authorities misleading us?\n\nWhat? If you seriously want to bring up a Science vs Religion death toll, I will urge you to remember that Religion is incredibly deadly. And still is today. Not to mention the people ignoring science and relying on praying to get better... and then die. \n\n&gt;We don't even understand the human brain.\n\nIf the human brain was simple enough to understand, we'd be to simple to understand it. We are talking about the most complex biological thing we know of. \n\n&gt;You don't know what the camera is capturing either.\n\nDepends on the style of camera, lenses, and sensor/film. We know how they work, and thus can know for a fact what wave lengths of light are being picked up. \n\n&gt;You don't know whether that reptilian face is real or not.\n\nOnce again, you've already edited the photo. Not only is that photo the camera's perspective, but you then change it. And if it's giving off light, and thus letting you see it, then the driver of that car would know about it as well. Most drivers look int he rear view mirror a lot and would not go unnoticed. \n\n&gt;You are assuming based on your past experiences.\n\nNo, I'm using Occam's Razor. It's more logical that a lower end camera has image defects, than demons exist. \n\n&gt;Others have had supernatural experiences.\n\nOr claim to. \n\n&gt;You don't know that sleep paralysis is merely a natural biological response that only appears external as an illusion.\n\nWhen you sleep your body releases a chemical that paralyses you. When this is a bit wrong, you get those without the paralysis, such as sleep walkers. Sleep Paralysis is the opposite, waking up while still unable to move. The sudden stress activated the fight or flight effect, while still half asleep. This can cause visual and auditory hallucinations. As is stated in my source in my previous post. \n\n&gt;But you can't replicate sleep paralysis dreams as an experiment.\n\nNo, but you can monitor people who are sleeping, monitor their brain activity, and then see when they're awake, or asleep. Then figure out what happens. Much like how we can't replicate Comets, Solar flares, Asteroids, etc. Yet we're able to figure out what they are by just waiting and getting a large enough sample size. \n\n&gt;You can't study something that can't be replicated \n\nThat's just plain false.\n\n&gt;Most of science and medicine is about makeshift labels and categories that are ever changing. When I studied science at oxford university my tutors expressed disappointlment in the mainstream rejection of anything that involved the unmeasurable and unreplicatable. The unexplainable is ignored and discounted. They don't bother with it. They don't have a way to measure or understand it yet.\n\nThis doesn't make any sense. Yes, 'alternate treatment' is ignored because if it was real medicine, then it wouldn't be labeled as such. Homeopathy for example is provably false. Yet people still cling to it. \n\n&gt;That doesn't mean people don't encounter spirits.\n\nMedicine and Science != Spirits. \n\n&gt;It just means we don't have ways to capture them and study them like the topics that science normally studies. \n\nNo. It's because they don't exist. \n\nYou cannot have something that interacts with matter, without having matter of it's own. Spirits are not scientifically proven, which means they lack matter. \n\nThings can still exist without matter. Such as light. However we can see these things due to the energy they give off. As such, if Spirits exist, it's not in the record-able spectrum of light. Sound is vibrations, and is lumped back into physical matter. \n\nBut we still know things exist when we can't see, or touch them. \n\nGravity is amazing. We know that not only dark matter and dark energy exist, but we know it doesn't compress, and is found around the outside of galaxies, yet there is still some all around us. However this is only trace amounts, and does not interact with light, or matter. We only know it exists due to gravity. \n\nhttps://home.cern/about/physics/dark-matter\n\nCould dark matter be spirits? Maybe. But once again, you wouldn't see it, or touch it... They would also be everywhere because it's incredibly common. \n\n&gt;That doesn't mean people don't encounter spirits. It just means we don't have ways to capture them and study them like the topics that science normally studies. \n\nI don't think you understand a very basic principle here. If you can encounter a spirit using the limited senses of the human body, Scientific equipment would pick them up easily. \n\n&gt;meanwhile all the predictions in the Bible are accurate so far.\n\nI, what? no. just no. \n\n&gt; I can't even assume that about tomorrow's weather forecast. It's frequently wrong In spite of it being rooted in science.\n\nWeather is the combination of everything everywhere and it's effect on, well, everything everywhere. To predict the weather perfectly would require knowledge of every variable in the Earth's ecosystem. That said, you're also lying. \n\n&gt;[For example, we can be 95% certain that a next-day forecast of 80\u00baF will likely correspond to an actual temperature between 75 and 83\u00baF.](https://www.minitab.com/en-us/Published-Articles/Weather-Forecasts--Just-How-Reliable-Are-They-/)\n\n&gt;Psychologists and chiropractors aren't able to measure and replicate results like the sciences but you probably think those are valid.\n\nDude, half of Computer science is \"This works, i don't know how, but it does\". Just look at Quantum Computing for fucks sake. Not every field of Science is Math. A lot of them fall back on the saying \"In Theory, Theory and practice are the same. In practice, they differ.\" We will never be able to test physics on a frictionless surface for example. \n\n&gt;They aren't anymore so than the study of supernatural phenomena.\n\nBoth of them have tangible evidence that what they do helps, and works. Whereas, like you said, there's no way for there to be proof of supernatural events. \n\n&gt;aka theories.\n\nOnce again I'd like to toss in a reminder, Gravity is also just a Theory. But you won't jump off a bridge to prove it false. \n\n&gt;They don't have answers, just theories.\n\nBecause the brain is to complex for us to completely figure it out? We know a LOT about the brain. We know of different areas, different chemicals, different mechanics inside the brain. But actually figuring out what being conscious is, is much harder than you may think. \n\n&gt; It's not like science has debunked the God theory.\n\nIt's not up for Science to disprove an idea. It's up to science to look at what's in front of it, and figure out what is there. It's up to you to prove god Exists, not others to prove he doesn't. \n\n&gt;We are all just cavemen making assumptions based on the shadows we see through the pinhole view we each have if reality.\n\nAnd if we followed the bible, we would still be avoiding pork since it doesn't cook easily. Science gave us stoves, fridges, and germ ***theory***. The bible gave us demons that make you sick. \n\n&gt;is that most of these religions are started as encounters with demons\n\nInteresting how these encounters, which can not be picked up by equipment, happened at all. Then stopped. \n\n&gt;They are easily conjured by sex acts and taking drugs among endless other ways including meditation and yoga.\n\n&gt;&gt;sex acts and taking drugs\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;***taking drugs***\n\n*sigh*. Seriously? Fucking seriously? You're basing demons exist because of hallucinations we can now prove all happen inside your head? \n\n&gt;Indians took peyote and were able to contact the fourth dimension\n\nWe are rooted in the 3rd dimension. We exist in the 3rd dimension. Our brains, which only exist in the 3rd dimension, when altered, in the 3rd dimension, change your way of thought. This is not only proven both accidentally, as well as purposely, but has been known for years. \n\nContinued in a post bellow.",

            "body": "If you believe in string theory there are at least ten dimensions. When you go up a dimension, it is but an infinite amount of \"points\" from the previous dimension. It applies to all the dimensions that we learned in math (a line is comprised of an infinite amount of points, 2d plane is comprised of an infinite amount of lines, the entire 3D universe is comprised of an infinite amount of planes). Going up a dimension to 4D would mean the entire universe is just one point. Time can be divided into an infinite amount of moments, or points. The fifth dimension means that the entirety of the fourth dimension (time) is just one point. This is where we see every possible choice in the universe creating a different universe (or if you don't believe in free will, an infinite amount of predefined universes with a set of choices per universe). Going further down the dimensions, if every possible universe exists in the 5th dimension what is missing? For each possible universe starting from the Big Bang to be one point, the next dimension encompasses an infinite amount of starting points of the universe (different than the Big Bang). To move to the next dimension you must ask yourself what is missing. Well, what is missing when you have every possible universe with every possible timeline. Consider that as one point in the next dimension, where mathematical constants and rules of physics are different in the infinite amount of universes. The question to answer is: if there is a PTB, which dimension does it exist in. Could the PTB just be a five dimensional being of our little \"point\" in the infinite amount of dimensions. Or is the PTB the power that lies in the last dimension, controlling every point in time of every world of every possible universe...",

            "body": "There's not much more to it than that. It's a primordial theory if a theory at all. Basically the red shift we see in distant galaxies is caused by the expansion of space and nothing else; there is no starting point. The universe is infinite and has existed for all of time, but if that were the case than time wouldn't actually be real and is just the manifestation of our awareness of our own mortality. It's been said in some books I've read that beings that could live forever could just wait around for quantum events to happen (like an apple tunneling to the other side of the desk. There's a minute probability of it happening and if you wait around long enough it will happen eventually) because they wouldn't really perceive time, it could behave as just another spatial dimension at that point. \n\nAnother element of this is the question all cosmologists ask: why is there more matter and so little antimatter? I think this is a silly question because it's asking why about an assumption. I have yet to see a study that actually says that the universe is made of matter, and that it's not just pockets of matter and antimatter that don't interact. This is bolstered by the recent measurement of the spectrum of anti-hydrogen, which was the same as regular hydrogen. The link to it was on this sub a few weeks ago. That being the case there's no way of telling another galaxy is made of matter or not because the light emitted from it looks the same either way; light doesn't care, the photon is it's own antiparticle. \n\nThe biggest hole in the \"new steady state membrane infinite universe\" hypothesis is definitely the pesky microwave background. Maybe the universe is a black body itself, but I have yet to come up with an elegant explanation.\n\nIf there's not already someone (you, I, or someone else) should make a sub like r/alternatescience or something to discuss ideas like this. A place where alternative ideas can be discussed without scrutiny or judgement, like a giant brainstorming group of people sharing theories. Take advantage of the social media revolution to do science better, not compromised by governments or corporate interests. Crowd sourced science is the future!",

As the Earth's frequency rises, people are beginning to question what 'they' are; not so much what is going on externally in the world. \n\nThe horrors that are making themselves known through the careless mistakes of TPTB -- or rather through the degree of negative energy created by the actions of TPTB that have grown so strong that they are no longer able to be veiled from our eyes -- are also resulting in plenty of people posing questions as such, \"Well, if everything I've ever thought to be true in the world was, for the most part, untrue, then is what I've thought I was all along not true too? Is this 'I' feeling really 'me'? What is 'me'?\" And that question, inevitably, leads to a spiritual awakening in which you realize that mankind is currently living in a state of insanity in which our true consciousness is veiled by ego, and ego is a false mental construction manifested by one's devout belief in one's thoughts. In other words, humanity spends so much time thinking nowadays that we've literally grown to believe we are our thoughts and have become attached to illusions.\n\nBut, we're stepping out of that dense, simple way of perceiving reality and are stepping into an illusionless world, where only truth reigns. No longer will the world be run by negativity and the selfish belief in a 'little me'. Rather, the world will be run by a more open-minded, united mass of people who understand, factually, that all of us come from the same One thing. We are all one, despite how corny or abstract that sounds.\n\nSo, I'm not sure I can agree with you. I don't consider an awakening to be something related purely to politics. You can be living in the jungle with no idea about what's going on in \"the real world\" and you can still be experiencing an awakening as your consciousness is literally entering a new dimension.\n\nYou've been awake for 20 years, meaning you've been more aware of the truth behind political/worldly issues for a longer period of time than others. But have you taken the time to contemplate what you actually are? Do you understand factually that you are everything you have ever experienced? Do you see clearly that all you have ever been is right here and right now? Do you see clearly that time is an illusion, that space is an illusion? These are the things to be asking right now, in my opinion. But kudos to you for being politically awake for so long; there are certainly plenty of people who need guidance from people like yourself at this point in time. Cheers, man.",

It means that while we've been restricted to the idea of traveling to other planets, we can  in fact travel to higher dimensions, possibly other versions of R^3 (although they would have the same physics for the initial discovery (linear R^4 before nonlinear)). In theory, other physical realities could be formed, although they could end up being logically equivalent (1-1 mapping) to this physics in the end. To answer your last observation, uncertainty is embedded in the notion of which is conjugate to the other via the phase ambiguity, and we have no means of knowing all the information precisely enough nor from all units in all existing universes and at any given point to know all of the solutions and dimensions and such. \n\nTL;DR: This could literally end up being be our evolution to a higher dimension. \n\nMathematically, every real function is said to be differentiable. Look up holomorphic functions. Everything is a real valued wave function, i.e. and infinite holomorphic function. I wonder why de Broglie and Bohm were \"convinced\" there work was shit.

Breitbart totally did the same thing.  He fought to stand up and expose things.  And yep.  You\u2019re right.  He got heart attacked.  Definitely.\n\nBut what\u2019s happened since?\n\nA whole nation of people now KNOW what he did, what he said, what he meant, and what the fucking PTB will *do* to you if you try to uncover their evil shit.\n\nThat\u2019s a great sacrifice Breitbart made, but it wasn\u2019t in vain because a *lot* more people know about the horrible shit going on and a lot more people now pay more attention BECAUSE of what happened to him.  So yeah.  He did do a lot and he did actually change things in the sense that he was one more drop in the kettle of citizen awareness with regard to how bad things are.  A few people woke up because of him.\n\nDid his efforts ensure that EEEEVVVERYONE woke up?  Of course not.  If that\u2019s your barometer, however, for whether something is \u201cworth it\u201d or not, then you\u2019re simply doing *life itself* all wrong.  Things don\u2019t work like that.  Change doesn\u2019t work that way - especially when what you\u2019re trying to change is something *big*; a status quo that has had everyone hypnotized for a LOOONG long time.  Not easy to change that, and it takes serious work to change *everyone* - and sometimes a lot of deaths, sometimes a lot of people making the ultimate sacrifice\u2026and Breitbart was one of the people who was willing to step up to the plate and expose things even at that risk.  It\u2019s obviously a massive risk, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it shouldn\u2019t be done anyway because everyone is, again, under a cloud of lies and deceit on this planet and things will absolutely not get better until we come to realize that.\n\nSame applies to George Webb.  Same applies to ANY truth seeker that\u2019s *really* working hard and making the effort to, again, *stand on their own two feet* and not live their life as a slave on their knees.\n\n&gt; You think in 2 dimensions where win/lose. If I dont go to a casino, I wont lose and the casino wont get any money from me.\n\nDude, you LIVE in a \u201ccasino\u201d.  Using your \u201ccasino\u201d analogy, it is actually *you* who lives in ~~two dimensions~~ one dimension because you don\u2019t realize that the \u201ccasino\u201d is everywhere.  It is your very *life*.  It\u2019s what you are brought up and indoctrinated to believe is the case from the time you are born.\n\nYou *live* in the \u201ccasino\u201d - the casino of the controlled manipulation which is this planet\u2026we *all* do.\n\nIt\u2019s just that some of us are more aware of this fact than others\u2026and I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re on the side you think you\u2019re on.\n\n&gt; If I dont post on google/youtube, I wont lose and google/youtube money from me. I come up with solutions where the income I generate goes 100% to me. David uses solutions where he only gets a portion of the ad revenue goes to him and the majority went to google/youtube/paypal.\n\nYep.  You\u2019re thinking in *extremely* small spheres of influence - and it shows.  Your *life* is controlled.  How you think, what you think, and why you think it is dictated by the influences that you had growing up - and those influences are predominately under the control of powers whose existence you\u2019re scarcely even aware of.\n\n&gt; What Im trying to encourage is people to stop and \"THINK\"\n\nYeah.  Me too.\n\n&gt; when you come up with an idea turn it into a business and implement it and become rich and use that money in a positive way to support people like David\n\nAnd what you come up with will still ultimately be under the auspices and under the control of your masters - which is *not* what I\u2019m ultimately talking about or referring to.",

            "body": "This phenomena is explained quite nicely by the Reciprocal System theory. The theory was first published back in 1959 by Dewey Larson and has since been expanded some by interested researchers, but it has been altogether ignored by mainstream science. \n\nIn this theory motion (or energy) is the fundamental quantity, being composed of space and time. Space and time are reciprocals of one another, hence the name of the theory. Light is then the vibration of space and time, and combinations of rotations and vibrations of space/time form matter. A consequence of this theory is that, in addition to 3 spacial dimensions you also have 3 time dimensions. Our waking consciousness perceives things in space/time, or 3 spacial dimensions plus one time dimension. Our \"unconscious mind\" however operates in 3d time + 1d space.\n\nIt turns out in this theory we find that stellar evolution is backwards as predicted by mainstream physics. A nice consequence of this understanding is that it gives rise to a natural explanation of planetary evolution. Planets are stars that have since died out - in fact, the core of planets are white dwarf stars. As the hot, dense core cools, it will expand. This is part of the reason for the expansion we've observed in this video. Another reason is the fact that the Earth is constantly moving through interstellar dust, and thus gaining mass by collecting the dust. This is a more constant increase in comparison to the larger shifts that can occur from the dynamics of the core. A detailed paper on planetary evolution in the Reciprocal System theory is [here](http://reciprocalsystem.org/PDFa/At%20the%20Earth's%20Core--The%20Geophysics%20of%20Planetary%20Evolution%20(Peret,%20Bruce\\).pdf). For more information on the history of Earth as pieced together from various maps, legends, and an understanding of the reciprocal system theory, check out this [paper](http://www.conscioushugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/The-Colonization-of-Tiamat-V-Phoenix-III-Daniel.pdf) by --daniel. \n\nFor more info about the RS theory, check [here](http://reciprocalsystem.org/)",

            "body": "A prophecy is being fulfilled, it seems to me the bible is being fulfilled. The bible predicts there will be a short reign of a female leader in \"mystery babylon\" which is Amurica. It also warns of a grand deception that will deceive even the elect, the elect are those who are elected by God to be more spiritually advanced than others.\n\nIt states there will be a war between two nations, south/north of each other. In my opinion Russia and America.\n\nIt says there will be 3.5 years of \"war on saints\" which is when the mark of the beast will get laid out. The only way I see people getting any mark whatsoever is if aliens come and supply us with it because people aren't dumb enough to get it any other way. In the bible it also states to my knowledge that ET's will be here.\n\nIf I can elaborate on some occult knowledge I have I will share with you some just so you can look into the rabbit hole for yourself.\n\nMagic is real and I believe entities are real. They are secretly dictating our world from the high ups. They feed on our spirits. Our world is a physical realm created from another realm. We exist in both realms. This world we live in is the \"fake\" world and the real world we can only access through certain drugs, those that Shamans, witches and alchemists use. DMT or Ayahuascha for example.\n\nI learned things from the spirit world and researching immensely. I just feel it happening. It's everywhere in music and such. Our minds are actually radios that come from the spirit world. God grants us knowledge and also demons, it's our choice and based on our spiritual capability that will decide which we give into.\n\nI'll just throw a bunch I have heard on the radio.\n\n\"I got guns in my head and they won't go, spirits in my head and they won't go\"\n\n\"This is it, the apocalypse woahh\"\n\n\"Something big I feel it happening out of my control\"\n\nIt's bigger than you can imagine so I'll try to touch on it some more. I have entertained many thoughts and what even the craziest conspiracy theorists would consider crazy I went farther I checked into everything and just looked around into what makes sense. My understanding, for anyone who studies the occult should see how it relates, Saturn is the planet all elite worship.\n\nThe reason they worship Saturn is because in reality. As Tesla said everything is vibration and frequency. Currently the earth and our bodies are 528hz. Saturn has the hexagon ring as shown in Jewish religion. As many know the Jewish people, zionist jews specifically, run the world banks and are a key part of the grand deception. Since everything is frequency I believe Saturn is influencing our planet and taking us into lower frequency. That is the reason we live for less than a century mainly. That combined with food and a stressful life to the maximum. It lowers our vibration.\n\nWhat is going to happen is Saturn is going to either stop vibrating and influencing us, or saturn is going to vibrate faster so that we raise frequency. In many holy books like the book of Enoch, Enoch lived for over 700 years. Today nothing like that is even fathomable. The reason is because we live in low vibration.\n\nCombine that knowledge with how you get the keys of knowledge. I know I had my break through when I was on a really big high. I felt low about myself and as Eminem would rap \"And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted\nIt's like the greatest gift you can get\nThe weight has been lifted\"\n\nFrom that point on I just knew something and dug deep for it. I followed all the greats and believed in destiny. Tesla said to understand the universe you must look at it as energy, frequency and vibration.\n\nVibrate high, be high yourself the view is way different from the top. Nothing really matters except avoiding this deception and I almost guarantee aliens will be a part of it.\n\nI don't believe in outer space I see the planets and all but I don't think they are what they think they are. Sounds make different shapes at different frequencies. That's why Saturn has a hexagon. It will change one day. It changed colors a few days ago for some reason. Think about that, if it's just a random planet why is it changing colors. Nothing is how they portray it to be. Welcome to the grand deception.\n\nEdit: I'll add in more just so you can see it better for yourself. Dr. Sebi cured people of cancer and aids proven because he beat the USA supreme court. Also a retreat deals with ayahuascha to remove your demons to make you healthier. Simply you are just removing the negative so that you vibrate higher. Dr Sebi advertises a high vibration diet that will cure anything by eating living foods to raise your natural frequency on your body.\n\nIf you have any questions ask but if you are going to hate I won't reply. Be respectful I know it sounds unreal but...\n\nyou gon' think a nigga psychic, you ain't seen nothin like this - jay z\n\nOnly the ones who are spiritually clean can see it. For now it is few I am hoping more will wake up it's seriously this simple just transcend the world and find the next dimension.",

They don't care about those people, they don't care about the refugees, if they did they wouldnt have created them in the first place &amp; they don't care about us either obviously .. I've read it from somewhere were they called the population \"useless eaters\"\n\nI mean everything seems to be going towards like that's what being planned. I mean they're going to install Hillary the FBI nobody's doing anything.  They started all these fires and we're running around trying to put them out while they're robbing the bank.\n\nThey try to make you think they're doing something &amp; that they truly care about the country  and the citizens &amp; the Constitution and what's right\n\nWere being played on grand scale I'm afraid. Why would anyone in the Government Federal to state want to fix what's going on? Its not broken for them, they're not broke. United states of america incorporated the corporation . The corporation by the corporations for the corporations .  ...Not Of the People by the people for the people . Like the people think .. all BC of the coup after the the revolution &amp; the act of 1871 that turned America into a corporation &amp; the states into Corporations.. And the law enforcement and so on and so on.\n\nif We really wanted to fix things wed have to start there and recognize that that was a false Constitution put in place to deceive us and extort money from us anddc take the country back that they lost , and so there is a shadow government we are being ran by a shadow government, not the original government that was intended.\n\nI learned a lot on annavonreitz.com &amp; its in chronological order. I cried for 3 days\nThe greatest fraud ever.\n\nI really feel like this is a computer model created by a computer and its just randomly putting together &amp; playing out different outcomes... There's billions of variations of outcomes but there's only one amazing perfect one, where everythings perfect.  There's green energy , the country is exactly what our forefathers intended, the world is complete and whole people live very long lives, we live off our land, we grow our own food, were free yet responsible we care about Community each other's children ...were self-sufficient, we have Commerce. We have effective space programs and we are colonizing and becoming Stewards of other planets, \n\nThere's no insurance, there's no IRS, no driver's licenses, you own your own home, people are not signing thier children away to the government as a slaves with a birth certificate to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange   . .... there's nothing unlawful ,, we're not Rats on a wheel , Citizens depend on local community government more than they do on national government, The law is \"no victim no crime\" there's only common law in civilian Courts presided over by common law judges which could be anybody fair &amp; honest in the community, instead of harsher admiralty law in military courts presided over by Foreign agents just to extort money, laws are only written to extort money from people ,.   . there's no more war in this perfect wave dimension because people are educated and they don't need violence to make things happen BC war is unheard of &amp; they use intelligence. it's Utopia people are telepathic; where we break out of The Matrix or the soul cage were trapped in here on the Earth due to the chemtrail metals being dispersed into the air and further controlled by harrp, metal in the food &amp; water  ..and even the Utopia runners-up that aren't So Perfect aren't even that bad to exist in,not as bad as what we're in right now.  \n\nEverything's on a loop I think, the aliens are us evolved, they say the universe is expanding.. ever seen an Infinity mirror?\n\nSorry I went off on a tangent but point is, They're making money all of them they're going to cashless currency. I think no matter if Hillary or Trump gets installed Obama's might come back and do a third term and finish up on the grounds of \"National Security\"\n\nRegardless what they do they can do whatever they want but one day there will be truth and justice\n\nI wouldn't be surprised about anything just stay vigilant",

These 'Monarch Slaves' are mind controlled by programming and seems to be a pre-requisite of success for the young 'stars' entering the fame game for the first time and some entrants are selected from birth and others are sold into slavery with the promise of fame, fortune and recognition involving immense amounts of money and are controlled throughout their career once they have 'sold their souls to the Devil' by 'handlers' or 'owners' who hold the 'keys' to 'unlock' the mind program to make the stars act and obey them into ever more sophisticated acts of pornography, Satanic sexual rituals, prostitution, drug trafficking even assassinations and although the stars are the most obvious cases the problem runs much deeper as even Policemen, Soldiers and members of the public come under control as the program is no longer the domain of guinea pigs as in the 1950's but is fully tuned in, tapped in and topped up and almost anyone is susceptible to 'mind control' as long as the handlers follow the program correctly but the majority of the 'victims' and 'survivors' come from multi-generational 'Satanic' families (bloodlines) and are ostensibly programmed 'to fill their destiny' as the 'chosen ones' or 'chosen generations' (a term coined by Dr Mengele at Auschwitz during World War II). This blog sets out to explain in graphic details including photographic evidence of the horrific blight on the landscapes of the entertainment industry and will lead you on a mind opening journey to the very top echelons of society to Governments and 'above'. Parental guidance is advised as some of the photographs contain nudity and we hope that in opening up the plight of the 'slaves' then the program can be dismantled and our proposals in Freudian based Psycho-dynamic Psychoanalysis can ease the trauma of unlocking the minds of the unbelievable number of victims as even the TV set you sit in front of is 'mind control'. The buzzword is 'wake up' be 'vigilant' and 'trust' in Jesus Christ the redeemer who is typing this blog in the NOW. Let us pray.\nMULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER:\nMPD also known as DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER (DID) and is the basis for Monarch slave programming add to this further conditioning of the victim\u2019s mind enhanced through hypnotism, double-bind coercion, pleasure-pain reversals, food, water, sleep and sensory deprivation along with various drugs is making Monarch slaves of 75% of the human population by altering certain cerebral functions. In relation to the most obvious victims; the entertainment industry stars of Hollywood a majority of the stars entering the fame game are coming from multi-generational Satanic families (bloodlines) and are hooked into becoming front line soldiers in the overall global attempt to stop the people waking up to the facts that there has been a complete control of their \u2018reality\u2019 by Reptiles (more of which later). Vast fortunes are being offered to the young dreamers entering Hollywood and for this blog as we are going to use our two examples of Monarch mind control programming KATY PERRY and JESUS CHRIST the MESSIAH we insert a great example of the danger these victims can be 1) KATY PERRY   https://youtu.be/CuLw2kwCN8A  here seen influencing the general public of America in which way they should vote to elect their President in one of her personalities an alta of the Hollywood star most girls would like to be. 2) JESUS CHRIST controls the Universal mind of GODS consciousness and CHRISTS consciousness which over half the population of the world sub consciously listen to. NOW put these two together and marry them then they would be either an unbeatable force for the GOOD if Jesus is the dominant personality but great evil if the handlers of KATY PERRY so decide because not only are these two married OMG but they merged in June 2014 as in ARISTOTLES \u2018True love is two souls inhabiting one body\u2019. We must add here that as you will see KATY PERRY has evil handlers but Jesus is such a dominant personality that when KATY PERRY became his handler and commenced trauma based MK Ultra mind control programming she failed to control all the already split personalities\u2019 that Jesus had developed under mind control exercised upon him by the French Foreign Legion in 1983 which just goes to prove that Katy\u2019s handlers are really not as good as you might think if they can\u2019t program someone to do their evil bidding if that person is already mind controlled programmed but the truth was that Jesus has only acted the victim and no one has been clever enough to capture his mind ever and how he beat it will be explained later in order for \u2018YOU\u2019 the reader to combat your own mind control programming whereas KATY PERRY is of such great danger of being totally exposed by Jesus and his Army thus punished by her handlers or more likely exterminated by her overall commanders the Illuminati that before this blog is published Jesus will expose those Reptiles at the top of the Pyramid in the Hollywood chain of command and the people they answer to. KATY PERRY is in fact showing signs of such DID that Jesus has offered safe harbour to her within his protective shield to deprogram her thus helping this blog to offer the answer to those in need. Therefore, when we are using KATY PERRY as our blogs example it goes right across the board that the mind controlled SLAVES are waking up and are working covertly with Jesus to unlock the control they have suffered from as mind controlled soldiers in a war called good and evil ~ they are forgiven for their part as we forgave the soldiers of Hitler\u2019s Army only interested in the top echelons of the command chain as it should be remembered that only JESUS offers eternal life as there is coming Judgment Day.\nhttps://sexkittendeprogramming.wordpress.com  http://sexkittendeprogamming.tumblr.com   internationalinternetwatch@gmail.com http://sexslavessexkittens.blogspot.com http://katyperryexposedsexkitten.tumblr.com \nhttps://mkultramindcontrol.wordpress.com/home  https://mkultramindcontrol666.blogspot.com  http://www.katyperryexposedsexkitten.tumblr.com\njesuskatyperry@gmail.com katyperryspsychicpi@gmail.com \nHOPE IS GIVEN TO THE SLAVES:\n222Hz Find your higher self for there you will tune into CHRISTS CONSCIOUSNESS BELIEVE IN JESUS HE IS NOT ONLY YOUR HOPE BUT YOUR SAVIOR: https://youtu.be/R3nAVFVwvUk In 2014 Jesus was born again Yehoshua HA~Mashiach and the first thing he did was open PANDORAS BOX with Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson ~ The Goddess ISIS ~ Mary of Bethany the Magdalena as PANDORA and the box was empty all that was left was HOPE all else was lost. Jesus Christs earth family motto was \u2018dum spiro spero\u2019 = \u2018where there is breath there is hope\u2019. HOPE was released into the Universe along with GODS (YHVH) LOVE and one day the story of recreation will be told but for now rest assured hope turned the Universe back on from its slumber of the 3rd dimension the Age of Pisces which had become old and stale and the peoples of Earth fell asleep. So now we have arrived at the Age of Aquarius in the 4th dimension where YHVH steered Earth into a new place in the Universe on our revolutions around the Universe where Earth had never been before with humans on it. Earth was travelling with no pilot on it and JESUS took the wheel. JESUS will speed things up into a 5th dimension and beyond so keep up and spread peace on Earth JESUS THE MESSIAH will stand no objectors to WORLD PEACE for JESUS CHRIST IS MUHAMMAD MAHOMET THE GAUTAMA BUDDHA therefore unite world the evil ones will be dealt with and the good will prevail.\n\nMONARCH SLAVE:\nA person who has different alternate personalities that they are unaware of. Clinically called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). These personalities can be triggered to come forward by their handler/owner. Each \u2018alter persona\u2019 has its place; for example, in women; the darling Mother alter that looks after her children (KATY PERRY IS KNOWN AS MOM TO HER VICTIMS, \u2018FANS\u2019) to the \u2018Mother of Darkness\u2019 alter who would be used in Satanic rituals (KATY PERRY MAKES HER VICTIMS MASTURBATE OVER HER NAKED BODY TO GIVE HER ENERGETIC STRENGTH). Alters can also be used for assassinations &amp; prostitution &amp; then programmed to forget what they have done. \nhttps://youtu.be/wHknzzJeK6Y \nAntichrist from Turkey. Obama lies impeach him",

What is it?\n\n&gt; Are we going to be liberated and it's just a waiting game until then?\n\nNa.  I certainly wouldn\u2019t say that.  Seems existence and the universe - God or whatever you want to call it - is holographic.  As such, everything is everything.  You are me, I am you, we are all each other.  Everything is everything.\n\nWe just have to arrive at the direct, experiential understanding of this truth.  Not easy to do by far, but I think liberation comes via this channel more than through anything any one book might say.\n\n&gt; I've read DMT reports, never done it myself though.\n\nGood.  You shouldn\u2019t.  I\u2019d say stay far, far away from it.  It\u2019s a limitation and a crutch - just like any external substance that is used to elicit any type of state.  The concentrated, disciplined, *sober* mind can achieve anything with enough practice and effort.  Any other means simply puts one more crutch, one more limitation, and one more impediment on one\u2019s ability to arrive at the Truth.\n\n&gt; There's also This\n\nExistence is like a radio.  We happen to live on the radio station called \u201cEarth in the third dimension\u201d, but even within *this very space*, there are many other different \u201cchannels\u201d so to speak, and if we have the ability to \u201cflip\u201d as it were from channel to channel, we would be able to witness many different beings existing in the very same space that we are in right now at this very moment\u2026just existing on a different frequency, a different dimension, a different wavelength.\n\n&gt; What is going to happen, when will it happen?\n\nIt\u2019s happening now.  It\u2019s already happening.  It\u2019s *been* happening.\n\n&gt; I hope tomorrow but I also recognize bible prophecy is coming true and it's very likely nothing will change until the messiah comes.\n\nOnce you tune in properly, you will realize that there *is* no messiah.  There is no messiah because *everything* is messianic and has the potential to be so.\n\nThe \u201cmessiah\u201d is *you*.  Like we were referring to at the beginning of this thread, part of the point of The Hidden Hand information is to show you/us how to elevate our own abilities and frequencies so that we can see that the very truth we are searching for is, in fact, inside of us already.  We don\u2019t need to be looking for it outside or in any \u201cother\u201d to bring it to us.",

Based mainly on the words of Jesus, who showed people how to love unconditionally and 'ascend' to another dimension. When I realized that with the Council of Nicea the Roman Catholic Church hijacked Christianity and chose what to put in the Bible and what not to, that was big eye opener. Especially, leaving out the Book of Enoch. Qumran, the discovery of the dead sea scrolls is very significant. I think the Catholic Church has a central part in a lot of what is happening right now: the great whore of Babylon.\n\nI will check out the others you recommend. Thanks much!!",

From my occult research I would say it would be that number because it's also from the movie and has not come up yet.\n\nAlso the military and others use \"10/4 over and out\" which does not seem to have an origin other than it was invented. Occult knowledge leads me to believe they are leaving hints. The bible also leads me to believe. I believe 2012 is when the fake reality began. I am not sure if I am also a victim to the false reality or if this is all there is. Cern is going to open portals and apparently judging from my research they have been able to pull demons to our dimension from other dimensions. Physical form demons not just the alien entities that currently exist here. It is speculation but judging from how much deception is currently on going I would assume something massive with the deception and Aliens is coming very soon. ",

Nanometers?\n\n&gt; All matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That's what reality is, and that's what everything is made of.\n\nThis sounds like a Bill Hicks quote. He's not a scientist. He's a comedian. I also think that reality is a bit more complicated than just slowly vibrating matter.\n\n\n&gt; If you look under a powerful microscope, at any physical object, you will observe the atoms \"vibrating\" at a certain wave length.\n\nYou must mean temperature. Kinetic energy... energy expressed as the relative velocity of a mass. Atoms don't \"vibrate\" by themselves. They are constantly colliding with other atoms. That's called Brownian motion. I guess a vibration could propagate through a solid, but that would be from an external force.\n\n&gt; Nothing is truly \"solid\" or \"stationary\" everything has a vibration.\n\nYes, because no particle can reach 0 K temperature, absolute zero.\n\n&gt;Let me try to provide an example.\n\nOk, please do. I'm genuinely interested.\n\n&gt; We live in a third dimensional reality and our minds are tuned (think of us as radios) to the third dimension.\n\nWhat? How? What thing in our brains enables us to do this? The pineal gland? DMT synthesis? Evidence, please.\n\n&gt; Everything in this world is in the third density or third dimension because that's the WAVE LENGTH that the atoms/molecules are VIBRATING at.\n\nAtoms are not vibrating at a specific wavelength. Just, no. You're getting confused with String *THEORY*.\n\n&gt; So when I say our vibration is raising, I mean that we are entering the 4th dimension and rising up out of the third.\n\nIs there breathable oxygen in the fourth dimension? Should we wear inter dimensional spacesuits? Are aliens waiting for us there, ready to calm us down with orange slices and some fetal spooning?\n\n&gt; It sounds like a lot of hoopla and science but that's the science way to describe it.\n\nNone of this is science. It is pseudoscience. It's entertaining to think about, but it provides no results and is ultimately a waste of time.\n",

If you are interested, go on yt and watch David Icke's speech called the History of the Archons. It is two parts but if you watch, you will be blown away. Also, it is amazing the things Icke has figured out that they do not want anyone to know about. The sickos don't have to do any research, they just get spoon fed piece by piece as they rise up through the ranks.

But if you dig further, you'll eventually discover that the quantum particles have no end in size. Meaning that size is infinite in both directions of scale. Just as Space is infinite, so is scaling downward past the quantum level. It just goes and goes... Tremendous when you think about that. \n\n*Edit: Sorry, I just realized that I didn't directly answer your question. Schizophrenics are probably stimulating their pineal gland in some extreme way.

            "body": "The Trump administration has already started poking/threatening Iran. I suspected the inclusion of Iran in the new exclusionary immigration orders was in preparation for further acts of symbolic and potentially eventually \u201ckinetic\u201d aggression against it. So I will reiterate what I said previously: \u201cI am concerned that Trump in his immigrant entry prohibitions is evincing sadism tout court and/or an act in preparation for war (you do not do what Trump is presently doing without giving the least prior notice unless you are making a declaration of open and direct hostilities and/or are engaging in the most denuded of demagogies). Trump has since the primaries evinced extremely strong sadistic tendencies; this is likely a personal preference and appetite on his part, but it also functions as a demagogic whetting or instruction in psycho-political sadism (inherent in oligarchic fascism), i.e. in the promotion, legitimization, intensification, and popularization of tendencies equivalent to sadism and Sadean personality traits in preparation for an initiation of open hostilities (though, at least initially, short of outright war) against significant nations and economic blocs of the world (Mexico, Middle East, China, EU) and against important, yet ostensibly foreign-like, demographic sectors within the U.S.: African Americans, Latinos, Muslims, Native Americans, even the \u201cunreliable\u201d majority of women concerned with equitable reproductive health access, etc.\nNationally, the logic of such a \u201cpolitical sadism\u201d would be in perfect complementarity with the international version: generalize the most divisive ethos short of actual militarized (dictatorially oppressive) action through full spectrum utilization of media in the service of an oligarchy that feels itself receding from relative and absolute power in a world ever more immersed in freely globalized trade (to reiterate, to the relative detriment of American hegemonic political and economic power). Trump, standard bearer for an oligarchy opportunistically directly stepping \u201cforward to the plate,\u201d promises millions of industrial sector jobs in a newly, if principally industrially, autarkic U.S. Maybe he will deliver in the mid to long term on this promise, in the immediate to short term his \u201cachievements\u201d will be essentially denagatory , denialist, negative, censorious: civic/humanitarian prohibitions, restrictions, dis-protections in the name of greater national security and policial exigencies; per oligarchic rationalizing protocol, best that the populace become ever more inured and desensitized to such civic and societal (oligarchically optative) harshness by being imbued in the \u201cmodelic\u201d sadism of a personally autarkic-hyper-capitalist cult leader figure (the effective opposite of Clinton\u2019s \u201cStronger Together\u201d): a sort of antipodal dimension Chairmen Mao of capitalist autarky (whose vision is to export, impose, and disseminate the same discoherent ideology throughout the world and have the U.S. be the isolationist leader of an isolationized world).\u201d\n\nAt this point I believe the probability of significant military action against Iran in the next four years is greater than 50%. If the Iranian regime is significantly destabilized/outright destroyed this will constitute in itself, regardless of whether regional chaos ensues as a consequence or not, an imperialist act in the fullest sense of the term, i.e. an act of imperialist \u201cexemplary\u201d aggression against the entire world, in other words, a show of putting the entire world \u201con notice\u201d (to quote Michael Flynn), that America\u2019s reach (i.e. intent) is now fully militarily totalitarian vis a vis the freedom of the world. An example of such a totalitarian aggression, is the entirely predictable/almost plannable destabilizing effect it would have on the European Union. Undoubtedly Cuba will also be on the regime\u2019s sights (for a \u201cregime\u201d it will be if it engages in such unqualifiedly aggressive hostilities).\n\nThe divisive opposition of the category \u201cimmigrants\u201d and \u201cworking class whites\u201d is entirely in accord with the present stage of the Trump administration: the \u201ctyranny of appearances\u201d/\u201ddespotism of forms.\u201d Trump is himself evidently tyrannized by this superficiality of concerns, condition which is in turn mirrored or mimetized in the sadistic superficiality (equatable to an intoxicative oblivion) he seeks to inculcate or awaken in his most fervent followers and expanding from there throughout the wider society. This tyranny of appearances/despotism of forms seems to account for the exceedingly notable lack of minorities and women in the upper echelons of his administration: Trump either lacks the substance (the self-confidence) to confuse his most nativist followers\u2019 expectations by forming a more diverse cabinet and team (reflective of both the forms and substance of American society as a whole) or his own personal superficial prejudices are directly informing his decision in this respect (let us recall his pettiness and callousness of his attacks against the physical appearances of Cruz\u2019s wife and Carly Fiorina, among others, during the primary). This surface tyranny already plainly evident in the demographic restrictiveness of the highest and most visible parts of his administration seems quite correlative and reflective of his political decisions so far, the two are inextricable and reciprocal. This surface tyranny may eventually be seen as a foretaste of future unprecedented despotisms of substance, or it may simply be revealed to be an unintentional unmasking and revelation of the \u201csurface level\u201d reality previously covering the already existing despotisms of substance inherent and inextricable from the hidden imperial governing apparatus itself.",

The majority of us completely forgot about our intimate connection to love and the collective consciousness of all beings. Which sent us down the path of lower consciousness, disconnected from love, a lower dimension consisting of separation and suffering. The Atlantean society was a post scarcity society and they were incredibly spiritual and understood their connection to all other beings, they emanated light and love. Much of their technology was based on crystals and vibrations, a MASSIVE  crystal Edgar Cayce dubbed the \"firestone\"  was their main source of power and I believe  ended up being the catalyst for the final explosion. As far as the forces of light are concerned, I'd refer to any entities that were fighting the souls using dark magic as forces of light, there was much fighting between the two groups and it was the beginning of the descent.

            "body": "&gt; Is it the illuminati?\n\nThe Illuminati are a defunct fraternity from the late 18th century that had some philosophical influence (esp. in France, if you agree with some views) in the early 19th century. Other than that, they've been irrelevant outside of science fiction (e.g. The Illuminatus! Trilogy) and conspiracy theory for the better part of two centuries.\n\n&gt; Skull n bones?\n\nA rich kids college frat, with initiation based on exposes of Masonic and other related fraternities. While rich kids are certainly a source of conspiracy in the modern world, S&amp;B probably isn't more interesting than any other rich kids frat.\n\n&gt; Bohemian grove?\n\nI've honestly never understood this one. It's essentially a rich and powerful version of a fandom con. It's not even initiatory as far as I've read, and has no ties that anyone has ever demonstrated to anything else. Again, if you think the rich and powerful tend to get up to no good, then you're paying attention, but BG doesn't seem particularly interesting in this respect when compared to anything else.\n\n&gt; Jewish elite?\n\nMostly the same as every other cultural slice of the global elite. The only difference is that Jews tend to have more sense of cultural and ethnic identity than most such groups. But do I think that Jews are more prone to conspiracy than, say, Hindus or Christians? Nope. We're all pretty good at being pretty bad in small groups.\n\n... skipping ones I know little about ...\n\n&gt; Freemasons?\n\nThe internal structure of Freemasonry makes any large-scale conspiracy impossible. Individual Freemasons, sure, but bad actors can have FAR more influence outside the Fraternity than inside. This is because there's no one central administration of Freemasonry, and jurisdictions are fiercely autonomous.\n\nNote: full disclosure, I'm a Freemason.\n\n... skipping more I don't know enough about ...\n\n&gt; CIA?\n\nThey've explicitly toppled governments, assassinated leaders and lead the US into war on false pretenses. I hesitate to call it \"conspiracy\" so much as, their publicly acknowledged job. :-(\n\n&gt; Enlightenment thinkers?\n\nOh, we're definitely running everything, and we're doing a terrible job of it. :-)\n\nBasically, everyone is an enlightenment thinker at this point. Most of the ideas  that were radical during the Enlightenment (like religious toleration and the value of rigorous experimentation) are now a common part of modern culture.\n\n&gt; Occult/esoteric study-ers?\n\nThis requires some understanding. \"Occult\" and \"esoteric\" merely refer to knowledge which is hidden behind some sort of initiation, whether it be self-study, social initiation or a formal ritual of initiation such as in fraternities. So everyone from the Lions to the local sports team are \"esoteric\" and \"occult\" in one sense.\n\nBut I assume you specifically mean in the sense of wanting to learn about the nature of reality and how to affect it (e.g. \"magic\"). Generally, I find that people who are interested in such topics tend to find less and less in the world of power-politics and finance interesting, so most conspiracies aren't actually of interest to the vast majority of people studying such topics.\n\n&gt; Mossad?\n\nSee CIA, above, they just have a smaller budget.\n\n&gt; Bolsheviks? Communists? Crony capitalists?\n\nThese are mostly arbitrary self-divisions. All political and finacial special interests will have their own conspiracies. That's the nature of that particular corner of the human psyche, I'm afraid.\n\n&gt; Reptilian? 4th dimension brings? Aliens? Do these groups overlap?\n\nYes, all three of those are based  on delusion.\n",

            "body": "I realize that there are some people who pick and choose what they want to believe and practice in any religion.  Some Catholics don't follow the commandments or read the Bible but they show up at church and let everyone know about it.  They sometimes even think Jesus is not real and that it's all symbolism like I once did. Some people like to dabble and do some light satanism like some do light Christianing. Oprah helped paved the way for people to think of religion as art.  Something you create for yourself according to your tastes.  I'm not talking about the \"satanists\" who don't believe Satan is real but just want to have orgies and not feel guilty about it.  I'm talking about real satanists.  The kind that worship by sacrificing and raping children or animals.  The ones that conjure demons and know Satan is real.  They know Jesus is, too, but they committed the mortal sin of rejecting Christ. \n\nI don't mind Goth kids and Harry Potter fans playing with oiuji boards either.  But that can open a gateway and the dabbling in witchcraft or drugs or even just trying to communicate with the other side can lead to possession. So I think their intentions aren't necessarily bad but the outcome can be.      \n\nIf you suspend disbelief for a moment just to entertain an idea, and you looked at it from the point of view of Jesus and Satan being real then what Joe Rogan is up to becomes more clear.  He's doing what oprah did but oprah can't take us to the next level past yoga and meditation.  You need a Joe Rogan to reveal the stuff that's more blatantly going to open gateways. He's relegated to podcasts which makes him seem more legit in that he's able to speak freely since there's less money and exposure. Kids won't run into his show by accident. Oprah is the pot and Rogan is the LSD if we looked at things in a quantitative way.      \n\nOprah opens the door and joe escorts you through the gateway to the fourth dimension where demons can more easily attach to you. She confuses you about what is real or right.  Just enough to be open to what Rogan is going to lead you to next.  But joe Rogan is really catering to the younger crowd. They are just branded according to the demographic they want to seduce.  That's just a possiblility. I feel strongly about it but Im well aware I could be wrong. I really liked the guy until I figured out what he is about.  Now I listen with an open mind that he might be sincere or he might be fucking donkeys regularly in front of an audience of mind controlled celebrity slaves at satanic gaylas.\n\n\nI also think Scientology is satanism rebranded.  They remove random low level demons from people and install the ones that they have contracts with that help them in the entertainment industry.  Demons have specialties. So they kick out the depression demon and install the \"make me sing like Adele\" demon for instance. Paid witchcraft services. The 666 and devil horn hand gestures help them sing better because it strengthens the ability of the demon to take control. But they have to make human sacrifices to get those demons to cooperate.  So maybe that's why people disappear. They had the power to bully the IRS into letting them be exempt from paying taxes.  I guess satanism can get more powerful when you have a network of satanists coordinating together like Scientology or illuminati.  Illuminati is really just satanism.  But perhaps it's one particular secret group of satanists that are more powerful than the rest or who work with or create public brands of satanism.  The billion year contract makes sense since you have to knowingly sell your soul to Satan.  And your soul exists for eternity.\n\nAll that isn't necessary to know the details of.  You just have to look out for the symbolism and agendas that are clearly satanic.\n\nTL;dr:  like oprah, joe is using the new age guru angle to promote satanism.  He pretends it's just curiosity and mind expansion but it opens gateways to possession. They both are just trying to lead people away from Jesus' protection from Satan.",

Presumably some of these were 6th density beings and thus \"not of this dimension\". \n\nQuoting Ra from channelings done by L/L research group back in the early 80s (note this was a question and answer format. [source](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=11)):\n\n11.25 **Questioner**: *Then I assume you can\u2019t name him and would ask you where Nikola Tesla got his information?*\n\n**Ra**: *I am Ra. The one known as Nikola received information from Confederation sources desirous of aiding this extremely, shall we say, angelically positive entity in bettering the existence of its fellow mind/body/spirit complexes. It is unfortunate, shall we say, that like many Wanderers the vibratory distortions of third-density illusion caused this entity to become extremely distorted in its perceptions of its fellow mind/body/spirit complexes so that its mission was hindered and in the result, perverted from its purposes.*\n\n11.26 **Questioner**: *How was Tesla\u2019s work supposed to benefit man on Earth, and what were its purposes?*\n\n**Ra**: *I am Ra. The most desired purpose of the mind/body/spirit complex, Nikola, was the freeing of all planetary entities from darkness. Thus, it attempted to give to the planet the infinite energy of the planetary sphere for use in lighting and power.*\n\n11.27 **Questioner**: *By freeing the planetary entities from darkness, precisely what do you mean?*\n\n**Ra**: *I am Ra. [Most of the following answer was lost due to tape recorder malfunction. The core of the response was as follows.] We spoke of freeing people from darkness in a literal sense.*\n\n11.28 **Questioner**: *Would this freeing from darkness be commensurate with the Law of One or does this have any real product?*\n\n**Ra**: *I am Ra. The product of such a freeing would create two experiences.*\n\n*Firstly, the experience of no need to find the necessary emolument for payment, in your money, for energy.*\n\n*Secondly, the leisure afforded, thereby exemplifying the possibility and enhancing the probability of the freedom to then search the self for the beginning of seeking the Law of One.*\n\n*Few there are working physically from daybreak to darkness, as you name them, upon your plane who can contemplate the Law of One in a conscious fashion.*\n\nTo summarize, Tesla wished to provide everyone with readily available energy for use in lighting, heating, etc. This is done by harnessing the energy naturally available by the Earth's electromagnetic field. This is made possible for reasons that still elude our \"current\" physics understanding. I put current in quotes because presumably secret government/corporate labs have developed physics far beyond what the public has access to, based on Tesla's works which were confiscated after he died and also based off of reverse engineering alien tech. Once everyone is in possession of this tech, we will have much more free time to develop spiritually, as Ra mentions.\n\nFor all of the question / answer sessions you can check it out here: http://www.lawofone.info/\n\nI don't know much about the occult side of things, but I do know that magical rituals have power based on the ability of the practitioner. There are also ratios of space/time used in these rituals that are the basis of their power, presumably because of the underlying structure that forms our current illusion, whose blueprint is provided by the Logos that formed the laws for our galaxy.  Ra discusses magical rituals, both black and white in some of the Q/A sessions, some good information may be available there. I don't know of any other good sources for info on occult stuff. ",

You have to internalize the fact that at the very *youngest*, the letters of the New Testament still address Hellenistic-era Greek and Hebrew peoples, living in a culture roughly 1900 years ago.  They wouldn't have the foggiest idea of string theory or multidimensional realities.  That disclaimer aside, I do believe Scripture addresses the *concept* of dimensions.  For a better scholarly review than mine, see [Chuck Missler's stuff on this very topic](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=chuck+missler+multiple+dimensions).\n\nThe very first reference, in my opinion, is in the opening verse of the Bible:\n\n&gt; **[Genesis 1:1 ESV]** In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. \n\nThe *heavens* could simply refer to anything we materially understand to be not earthly; however, the all-powerful Creator of all things must have created all the dimensions, and the laws by which they operate.  I view *heavens* as the material and spiritual realities of existence, and thus this is a multidimensional statement.\n\n&gt; **[Isa 57:15 KJV]** For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name *is* Holy; I dwell in the high and holy *place*, with him also *that is* of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\n\nGod inhabits eternity.  Impossible unless you consider the concept of a Being who resides in a dimension higher than the one in which you currently reside.  Think of *Flatland* for this one.\n\n&gt; **[1 Timothy 6:16 KJV]** 16 Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom *be* honour and power everlasting. Amen.\n\nGod also dwells \"in the light which no man can approach unto...\"  This could be read as a simple literary device, but it also represents undeniable scientific truth.  No man can \"approach unto\" light, the speed of which happens to be the limit of velocity within this dimension of the universe we inhabit.  Interesting coincidence, if you ask me.\n\n&gt; **[John 1:1-3 KJV]** In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.\n\nThis verse, speaking of Christ, can also be read as a literary device.  But as a Christian, I take it as literal truth, and yet another veiled reference to a multidimensional reality.\n\nThe following verse also speaks somewhat to your hollow earth comment, though I personnally see hell as a dimensional reality rather than a physical one:\n\n&gt; **[Philippians 2:5-11 KJV]** Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of *things* in heaven, and *things* in earth, and *things* under the earth; And *that* every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ *is* Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\n\nAnd then there are the references to the \"heavens rolling up like a scroll\" and other ideas that imply multidimensional understanding.  But the most significant aspect, in my opinion, is that the Bible *itself* is extradimensional due to the accuracy of prophecy in Scripture.  The ability to predict events hundreds, even thousands of years in advance alludes to an inspiration for the authors that exists outside of our spacetime itself.\n\nBut, in the nostalgic and true words of our beloved LeVar Burton: \"Don't take **my** word for it...\"  There are some really good resources out there which are scoffable for non-Christians (and even many Christians), but I'll direct you to them since you asked:\n\n* [Chuck Missler](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=chuck+missler+multiple+dimensions)\n* [The Gospel in time and space](http://creation.com/the-gospel-in-time-and-space)\n* [Are Parallel Worlds Biblical?](http://remnantreport.com/cgi-bin/imcart/read.cgi?article_id=580)\n* [Did God Create a Multiverse?](http://bylogos.blogspot.com/2013/01/did-god-create-multiverse.html) - *Though I do not believe there are infinite parallel realities, this is an interesting read*\n* [Revelation 14: Multiple Dimensions](http://bereanbiblecorner.com/2013/10/16/revelation-14-multiple-dimensions/)\n* [The Extradimensional Nature of God](http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/xdimgod.html)\n* [Physics and the Bible: The History of Hyperspace](http://www.khouse.org/articles/1997/29/)",

It's just referencing the reptilian center of the brain.\n\nYou're quite wrong about this. Have you actually read his work? When he first started talking about reptilians, there was no ambiguity there: *he was talking about an actual reptilian race*.\n\nJust a few of many quotes from The Biggest Secret:\n\n\"My own research suggests that it is from another dimension, the lower fourth dimension, that the reptilian control and manipulation is primarily orchestrated. Without understanding the multidimensional nature of life and the universe, it is impossible to follow the manipulation of the Earth by a non-human force. As open minded scientists are now confirming. Creation consists of an infinite number of frequencies or dimensions of life sharing the same space in the same way that radio and television frequencies do. At the moment you are tuned to the three-dimensional world or third dimension and so that is what you perceive as your reality.... It is from one of these other stations or dimensions, that the Serpent Race, the Anunnaki, is controlling this world by 'possessing' certain bloodline streams... \"\n\n\"Other people know this as the lower astral dimension, the legendary home of demons and malevolent entities in their black magic rituals.... Then there are the experiences of Cathy O'Brian, the mind controlled slave of the United States Government for more than 25 years, which she details in her astonishing book, Trance Formation Of America, written with Mark Phillips. She was sexually abused as a child and an adult by a stream of famous people named in her book. Among them were the US Presidents, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton and most appallingly, George Bush, a major player in the brotherhood, as my books and others have long exposed. It was Bush a paedophile and serial killer, who regularly abused and raped Cathy's daughter, Kelly O' Brian, as a toddler before her mother's courageous exposure of these staggering events forced the authorities to remove Kelly from the mind control program known as Project Monarch. Cathy writes in Trance Formation of America of how George Bush was sitting in front of her in his office in Washington DC when he opened up, a book at a page depicting \"lizard-like aliens from a far off, deep space place\". Bush then claimed to be an 'alien' himself and appeared, before her eyes, to transform 'like chameleon' into a reptile.... I know other people who have seen George Bush shape-shift into a reptilian.\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"It is clear that Diana knew about the true nature of the royal family's genetic history and the reptilian control. Her nicknames for the Windsors were the \"lizards\" and the \"reptiles\" and she used to say in all seriousness:\"\n\n\"They're not human\"...\n\n\"The brotherhood obsession with Scotland, she said, was because there are many entrances there into inner-Earth where the physical reptiles live... She said that during the sacrificial rituals the Queen wears a cloak of gold fabric inlaid with rubies and black onyx. The Queen and Charles have their own ritual goblets, inlaid with precious stones signifying their Illuminati-Brotherhood rank. The Mother Goddess says that that queen makes cruel remarks about lesser initiates, but is afraid of a man code-named 'Pindar' (The Marquis de Libeaux) who is higher in the Satanic hierarchy.\"\n\n-----\n\nThere is nothing ambiguous about his beliefs. He's talking about actual, physical, shape-shifting lizard people.",

A couple of us decided to take \"heroic\" doses of Psilocybe mushrooms one evening. I chewed down four grams, retired to my tent, closed my eyes, and got horizontal on my air mattress. As the effects of the 'shrooms came on, my inner vision revealed what looked like a dank moss-green hospital emergency waiting room. I seemed to be sitting on a bench in this room, and it occurred to me that it was odd that there were no patients being wheeled in or out. Kinda quiet for an ER. After some time, I noticed a few off-white football-sized larvae floating three or four feet off the ground in various spots. Following one of these with my eyes, I then saw an insectoid entity about the size of a small dog, whose back was facing me. It had a long mosquito-like proboscis that I could only partially see. Suddenly, it turned, and--realizing that I saw it--it made a high-pitched buzzing/shrieking sound. (I got the impression that it was sending out a warning alarm.) The entity then initiated telepathic communication with me, explaining that it was quite surprised that I could see it, as this usually didn't occur. It said that it lived by extracting human thought/emotion. Human thoughts were both the currency of its species, as well as their sustenance/energy source. (The needle-like proboscis was looking less friendly by the minute.) I was given the impression that--as the coin of its kind--different types of thought/emotion were valued differently; those with a more intense energy charge, such as fear or love, were worth more. The entity explained that it existed in another dimension so that it could feed off of human thought unhindered. (I got a feeling that the relationship wasn't symbiotic; perhaps these \"thought drainers\" somehow suck life energy from humans, along with the mental energy.) It claimed that it was the psychic equivalent of an actual insect that feeds on blood, skin, etc., with regard to the extent of any damage it might do to those on whom it fed. Yet I had a nagging feeling that it might not be telling me the whole truth. Maybe these creatures had some influence on inciting wars or disasters in the human realm? The experience left me feeling unsettled for some time afterwards.",

There are an additional 6 or 7 dimensions depending on how you do the math. These dimensions theoretically exist just outside our perception, much like most of the light spectrum escapes our ability to perceive it (though that does not mean infrared light is a myth). \n\nSo there are exactly 4 dimensions that we know of: one of time and three of space. The time dimension needs no explanation; The three space dimensions are obviously length, width and height. The math dictates there are more dimensions, otherwise the rest of the universe would not exist around us the way it does. But regardless of whether or not you believe math and string theory, there is definitely more than 1 dimension. \n\nThat is why I suggest reading up on this before discussing it. ",

            "body": "Maybe people called him insane because of stuff like this.\n\n**\"David Icke (pronounced \"Ayk\": \"Ah-e-k\") is probably best known for his contention that most of the world's leaders are actually reptilians in disguise and that the world is controlled by a vast conspiracy of a few families who have conspired to keep their world domination.*\n\n**The reptilians serve as prison wardens and hail from the constellation of Draco. Icke says they manipulate our world from the fourth dimensions, which he says is on the lower astral plane and is a \"cess pool.\" They are seven feet tall, capable of shape shifting to disguise their true nature, and they feed off of negative thoughts. They create conflict to create more negative thought.*\n\n\n**Moreover, not only are they in this other dimension, they are also manipulating events from our own. In an interview with Rick Martin in the Spectrum newspaper he traces his theory that most all American presidents come from the same bloodline, that the Windsors are reptilian, and that they had Diana murdered because she found out. From the interview\"*\n\n\n**\"So, The Biggest Secret for me, in summary, is that an extraterrestrial race has interbred with humanity, creating particular hybrid bloodlines which they can work through from this dimension very close to ours, and that as it expanded over the thousands and hundreds of years to the present day, they've managed to expand their power out of a power base in the Near and Middle East, other places too but particularly there, until today they are actually in control of the planet.\"*\n\n\n**He frequently makes a distinction between the 'Five Senses Conspiracy\" and the real nature of reality, which is inter-dimensional in nature. He says our senses take in vibrations at a very narrow level and our brains turn this into what we think of as reality, which is really only a very good virtual world not unlike The Matrix.*\n\n\n**Icke left school early and played professional football (soccer) in England. He then became a sports reporter and a spokesperson for the Green Party. A series of paranormal experiences led him to a psychic who told him he would be a great healer. He was laid off from his job as a reporter and at the same time he had an urge to visit Peru. After another 'kundalini type' experience in Peru he came back to England and began telling his story. He faced massive ridicule and left the public stage for some time. He says this experience taught him to not care about what other people thought. At one speech he faced fifteen minutes of catcalls before he was able to speak. he said, \"You all think I am mentally ill, don't you?\" Most of the audience yelled agreement, and then he said, \"What does this say about you? You just paid money so you could come ridicule a person you think is mentally ill.\" he says that subsequently the audience behaved.*\n\n\n**Icke has written many books on his conspiracy theories. he has become a popular speaker who no longer faces ridicule from his audiences. He has been accused of anti-semitism, likely from referring to the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion,' a proven fake that suggests a small cadre of Jews rules the world. He vociferously denies the charge calling it 'frigging ridiculous.' His conspiracy theories do tend to pin much of the world's troubles on a ruling elite that creates crises, wars, and strife for their own benefit, but he clearly states that though some Jews might be involved, it is not a Jewish conspiracy. He has also attracted attention from right-wing militia groups, which he also disowns as frightening.*\n\n\n**Icke believes that events take place at a vibrational level and that the conscious mind is a receiver and experiencer only and is never responsible for any decisions whatsoever. He believes change can happen only at a level higher than the five senses, and this is the level at which the reptilians are attempting to maintain control.\"*\n\n\nhttp://www.ufowatchdog.com/david_icke.htm",

The idea that it's all the work of talmudic jews of the 4th dimension or a literally satanic believes-in-fucking-magic cult are discomfortingly popular, and comments criticizing these beliefs get downvoted and ridiculed. It's crazy.\n\nAnd these people are convinced that Trump is The Savior and that he's going to fix all of these problems (although I've encountered this attitude IRL as well, some old lady just barked \"CHINA! TRUMP WILL FIX IT\" when I explained planned obsolescence to her), that it's all Democrats and their corrupt evil satanic ways that are destroying our country. \n\nAnd since they're all obsessed with this absolutely loony shit they ignore the billionaires and millionaires openly working against them in broad daylight. They ignore that they have more in common with their black coworkers than with fucking Donald Trump. But I guess it's really hard to deprogram yourself from a lifetime's worth of pro-capitalist propaganda, even though you'd think that a conspiracy minded individual would start to question things like that. I'll never understand how anybody could connect the dots through all this crazy shit, but not think it's awfully coincidental that Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated as he was uniting the black and white working class to demand an Economic Bill of Rights to guarantee a standard of living for all poor.

Their chief producers though all quashed it by pressure from the powers that be/owners of their \"news outlets\".\n\nAfter reading hundreds and thousands of stories, watching thousands of hours of footage, I have come to the conclusion that literally anything is possible. Our time reference is merely what we exist in like a bubble, our time is not applicable on a universal scale. There are light beings, to extra-dimensional beings, to what we'd see as monster entities. Many live on and within our planet, and others come from outside our known dimension set. \n\nI could go on, but complexity is increasing by the day. Our destiny is to travel the stars to be ETs to other underdeveloped people on distant planets (cycle of life, technology, evolution), but of course all the processes necessary to get to that point might take 30, 100 or 200 years. Given humans were going to the toilet in backyard sheds less than 100 years ago, now we have computers running everything, I'd say this new chapter is not far away.",

The Archons are Evil Parasites and could be described as Demons. They are from the lower Astral Dimension, and use humans as an enslaved energy source to feed upon. After some time in the fake \"heaven\", you are told you agreed to \"soul contracts\" very long ago and have to keep reincarnating to pay off your \"karmic debt\". It is a complete lie.

            "body": "Just a thought: In regards to scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and academics, if we step into a hypothetical reality where God, Satan, angels, and demons all exist (presumably in a realm/dimension/capacity beyond our comprehension) and we know that to 100% fact (again, hypothetical), then what gives science\u2013the irrefutable cornerstone of modern societies\u2013the power to overrule and invalidate the heavenly realm? After all, science is an ever-evolving process that continues to accumulate knowledge as time goes on (i.e. by nature it is incomplete), slowly learning by trial and error, rinse and repeat etc. \n\nSo if in this hypothetical world we admit that there are entities and beings beyond our realm, how can one say anything along the lines of \"With science I've disproved God!\" (not your words, just an example to illustrate my point) with any more relief and comfort than those who adamantly believe in said realm? After all, I highly doubt that every scientist, engineer, mathematician, and academic has poured through every record of scientific data and therefore must be operating on some notion of faith/presumption that the words written in well-revered articles are in fact true and conclusive. When you start to analyze this stance from a philosophy standpoint, it really starts to unravel and place huge cracks in the concrete-ness of the Unquestionable Scientific Authority (for lack of a better term).\n\nI'm not trying to convince you one way or the other, I'm just floating out the thought of \"Why are you so confident that things unexplained *and unexplainable* by science simply cannot exist?\" Perhaps it provides one holding that viewpoint some sort of comfort and assurance that the reality you've been pitched your whole entire life *indeed is* the way the world/universe works, which draws loose parallels to the way America thought the election would work out prior to their rude awakening. Perhaps you don't *actually* deny this theory entirely but rather accept that based on what seems to have worked for you up til now, the *likelihood* of it being real is low enough to where you can safely assume it is not. But again, if we're in this hypothetical reality, isn't that exactly what a Lucifer-figure would want of you?\n\nSorry to ramble, these kinds of thoughts bounce around in my head on a daily basis. All I'm really trying to say is, while you can be sure of the *chances* of one thing, you really can never be too sure of any one thing entirely. And in light of all the crazy events that have happened in the past decade and beyond, I'm very hesitant to ever call anything farfetched. After all, didn't we all used to regard people claiming the government was tapping their phones as tin-foil hat wearing crazies? Low and behold, the NSA has been active and not without work for quite a while up until Snowden blew his whistle. Just another example to show no matter how ridiculous something sounds (often times by design to muddy up the waters), the status quo with which we draw comparison to (eventually concluding that it's farfetched etc.) is not as infallible as our comfort-seeking-brains believe it to be.\n\nIf any of that was unclear I'd be happy to further expand/ramble. I'd love to hear your thoughts!\n\nEdit: grammar",

He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.\n\nFor Nephilim/Biblical:  Genesis 6:4-7; Numbers 13:33 (NIV) -- BibleGateway.com is a good resource for finding scripture \n\n       As associated with CERN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5H7r7siGts\n\nFor Mandela Effect (long but good explanations): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5NVS6z8S_U\n\nInformation on supposed \"aliens\" is often intermingled with that on demons; the biblical explanation for \"beings from another world\" would be demons/Nephilim residing in an alternate dimension or reality (see CERN, quantum computing). CERN's work is designed to open a hole into another dimension via breaking apart all particles into their most finite elements. The \"god particle\" (Higgs bosun) is seen as a negative force that is powerfully attracted to other negative elements...thus, if the portal is opened (as it presumably has been in the past), the entities released will gravitate toward creating destruction. \n\nThere are many great reading resources, but videos are a good start. Let me know if you would like more resources -- I am happy to help. \n\n\n",

Descended from a higher dimension into our lower 3rd dimension (fallen angel).\n\nThere is a coordination between this 'intelligence' and archons (demons) which are also astral/plasma. Possession of these astral parasites is a real phenomenon and manifests as a compulsion to act against 'natural law'. Ancient spiritual teachings are really based in science but lack the vocabulary we have today. \n\n'Satanic' acts are a form of energy exchange which feeds these parasites. Luciferians are aware of this being and have used religion, banking, government to serve and enslave in the name of this being, under the guise of practicing 'free will' for thousands of years.\n\nSatan is a completely different thing though, an ancient Sumerian ET visitor (probably in the same family of Enki and Enlil) although the word 'satan' is a title and not a name - meaning to stand against or something similar. The role of satan was a tool used in ancient Luciferian religion (Roman Catholicism).\n\nModern Satanism is playing the same game as the Abrahamic religions, yet without the concealment.\n\nTo be clear, the teachings of Jesus and other 'masters' was antithetical to all of this, yet twisted into this same parasitical game.",

            "body": "I'll get downvoted into oblivion for pointing this out, but we have to resist the notion that the past = the present. That is to say, it's intellectually dodgy to equate the vile ethnic cleansing of the North American continent (in what was a political campaign) to the modern-day \"mass shooting\" phenomenon.\n\nMass shootings are when (a mentally unhinged) Citizen A goes and shoots Citizens B, C and D.\n\n(All are in the same country, and hold the same nationality.)\n\nNative Americans didn't become US citizens until 1927.\n\nIn 1890, when the Wounded Knee massacre happened, it wasn't a \"mass shooting\". It was a war.\n\nCitizens of a Western political construct called \"the United States\" shot non-citizens of the United States.\n\nNative American tribes (like the Lakota tribe or the Sioux nation) were seen as autonomous nation-states, and the U.S. signed treaties with them as if they were no different than Japan, Brazil or Iceland.\n\nSo now that you have the historical and geopolitical context, the reality is: We can't equate it with a modern-day school shooting, but with an on-going war. In terms of wars, 300 shot dead is child's play compared to something like the Firebombing of Dresden (which killed 600,000) or the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nTo compare Wounded Knee to something like Columbine or Sandy Hook is disrespectful [and it minimizes what really happened]. This was not the result of a drug-addled teen stealing Mommy's gun and shooting randomly at strangers. It was a government campaign, done with cold, calculating deliberation. It was government policy.\n\nBut, sadly [even conceding to its ethical seriousness] as wars go, it hardly registers in the public consciousness because it was so modest in dimension compared with the bloodbath that was to unfold in the 20th Century.",

            "body": "Most of the people you see are not in their bodies. Their body is in too much pain from emotional/mental insecurity. This causes their spirit to hang out outside their body. The mind runs the body if the spirit is out, and you can see this across the board with people. Anyone running a fake social perspective is generally out of their body. Their mind's residual self image (RSI) is generating what they should say, do, and feel as a form of survival and safety. The actual act of getting in your body requires years of meditation to allow an energetic resonance and harmony between the spirit and body/mind.\n\nAlso, the mind cannot be freed from the body. It is a mechanism of the body. Your consciousness can be freed from the body, which I'll assume is what you are talking about. This is definitely possible, and attainable by any reasonable person, and even by an unreasonable person with enough determination. \n\nThe internet is full of techniques for all sorts of astral projections and travel. Generally these are a quick fix, that allows you to hover in your room before slamming back into your body. The actual act of separation of spirit and body is a form of death. It allows you to learn about death, and feel the parts of yourself that are tied to the turmoil of the mind. If you can allow yourself to surrender those anxieties, you will find yourself much more capable of leaving your body.\n\nOsho gives a great set of meditations for this. I have practiced these, and many like these, since 2003. They are simple, but very effective. Both can be considered dying techniques. Thus allowing you to die as your body lives on, aka, freeing your consciousness from your body. Another way of seeing this, and how it feels to me, is that the body and its fear of mortality are always there, as you release yourself from those fears, your leave more space in your reality for your subtle world. You basically become the higher self to the body, and as it goes on talking, eating, drunk texting, etc. you are able to sit in it, or out of it, and bask in the perfection of all things. There is no desire to control or change your body, because there is no desire at all outside of the body. This leads to a deep acceptance and love of your body, mind, failures, insecurities, and inevitable death. This eventually leads to the accepting of other people, their bodies, their flaws, and the ability to see each spirit connected to each body/mind.\n \nThe Death Meditations\n\nThe first one is the act of dying, and that requires laying down. It also will take at least a few hours, if not days, to really experience.\n \nOnce you find a comfortable position, close your eyes and take five very slow, very deep breaths. Breathe into the resistance in your lungs and body, see it as trapped tension. As you breathe in, you capture it, as your breathe out you release it. Do this until you have figured out how to become more relaxed, and release the tension in your body. Do this for all major tensions in the body. (This is also giving yourself a very efficient energy healing)\n\nNow imagine your energy is being sucked out from all sides. Your very life essence is being exhausted. As you lay there, feel your body becoming cold. Feel yourself surrendering to your death. \n\nOver the course of an hour or two, your body should become very heavy and cold. So heavy that you can not move it. \n\nNow there are a couple different options here. Keep in mind this is the novice meditation. The real hardcore meditation takes you to your actual death, and at the point of your body being just about to die, you can stand up without your body. You can at this point use many techniques. My current favorite for getting out is the yo-yo technique. You will know you are at the right point when you can see through your closed eyes. This is your astral vision, btw. \n\nWith eyes closed, and body totally relaxed visualize someone stringing a yo-yo down in your face, it starts at an imaginary hand about 3 feet above your face, and lands inches above you. As the yo-yo continues to go up and down, start feeling yourself moving with it. Slowly you will feel yourself start to move, which is impossible due your body being incapacitated. You will start to feel the seam of your awareness to your body. Slowly relax and allow yourself to rise out. If you make it out, let me know, and I'll give you three options for when you get out. This is getting a little long, and it takes a while of hard practice to get to this part. \n\nThe second death meditation is very simple. Exhaust your body to the point of collapse, and as the body falls down, stay standing. This can be achieved through intense workout. I've also reached it during long fasts. Basically work the body until it cannot stand another second, and when it falls, stay standing. \n\nI am in no way responsible for the outcome of anyone who tries these techniques.\n\nThis technique is very challenging and somewhat dangerous. If you can do it, however, you will see where your consciousness is really located, and you will be able to go in and out of the body as you please. \n\nLike I said, both techniques require you coming to terms with your body's resistance one way or another. There are many paths to this, one need only bless what they are already experiencing, and they are 9/10ths there.\n\nThe experience is indescribable, but I'll try, because for years, I was never able to find someone trying to explain it. Watch the movie \"Enter the Void\" it is similar to that in one regard, that movie lacks the large spiritual download that happens, but imagine a reality where all information is known, and can be known to you through subtle feeling. The emotions of the body are turned down, and you can finally feel the interconnection of all things via emotional feedback. This allows you to pinpoint your exact core frequency. Once you do that, you will be able to see the whole world is created by your frequency. After that you can control your frequency to jump between an infinite amount of alternate earths based on your core frequency. Eventually you find the core of your belief in Earth and alter that frequency to harmonize with your one true essence. No death, no desire, no 3rd dimension, nothing. You can come and go as you please. \n\nThis is all very advanced, but I hope this ignites your soul again to find who and what you really are.",

My thought is if this civilization was potentially advanced enough to understand how our planet related to the rest of the universe then it's possible they left earth or died trying. They likely would have had the technological understanding to go much further than the moon, but not in a space ship kind of way. If they had an advanced understanding of quantum mechanics it's possible they figured out how to leave either this galaxy, universe, or dimension.\n\nThere's a theory that the earths polar vortexes have the ability to be used as a gateway, portal, or worm-hole. Research Antarctica conspiracy theories and there's a lot of research dating back to this, particularly during WW2, the Nazis, and the 1950's. Supposedly Hitler and factions within the Nazi party were obsessed with this theory of ancient civilizations, flying discs, and Atlantis. It's possible that's why Hitler refused to bomb museums and certain historical monuments, and collected as much he could from the past seeking clues to a lost ancient civilization. It's likely that the US resumed much of this research after we defeated the Nazi party, and still have considerable research and military presence in Antarctica.\n\nIt's been further theorized Antarctica was home to at least some part of this ancient civilization or perhaps had a physical indicator of how to enter the earths polar vortex, and may still be frozen. \n\nAnyhow, this a wrinkle on your moon theory the combines wormhole theory, and could even considers quantum mechanics and multiverse theory. So you're definitively on to something, but it's probably more complicated than the moon / aliens. ",

            "body": "From another /r/conspiracy user:\n\n&gt; (this list isn't nearly everything [...] ):\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Benevolent ET life exists, and has been peacefully visiting Earth since before we were throwing spears. As a species, we discovered their presence mainly during WW2, but it has been covered up since. It is known that their visiting us intensified dramatically after we started detonating nuclear bombs. ETs have been seen deactivating and/or \"disappearing\" nuclear missiles, both in their silos and in flight, as they see nuclear bombs as an existential threat to life on other planets. Because of our violent tendencies, the greater good of the universe (ETs) will not currently allow any human being past the orbit of Pluto. We are too violent.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Human beings, being the violent ape species we are, have shot down and reverse engineered ET technology, which includes but isn't limited to: Scalar/faster than light weaponry, faster than light and silent dimension-warping and inertia-shielded travel, highly advanced genetic engineering and nanotechnology knowledge (including the ability to \"grow\" \"robots\"), large-object invisibility, monetarily-\"free\" and limitless energy production, extreme bodily damage medical repair (including limb, spine, eyeball, etc regrowth/regeneration). The scalar satellites now in place, can also instantly detect when ET craft \"phase\" into visible reality, and can instantly shoot them down (this is why the average person no longer sees flying saucers/ET craft; they're being actively hunted by these orbital weapons)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) And the most insidious concepts revealed: black-ops government projects exist that violently abduct humans under the guise of \"alien abductions\" (using the aforementioned \"robot\" tech to convince humans, subconsciously that aliens are \"evil\" and to be feared). They have done this to laymen as well as heads of large governments, to convince them that \"Aliens\" will assassinate them if they step out of line. This is all in preparation of a coming false-flag hoax \"alien\" attack that is being planned to, quite literally, militarize all of Earth itself for the benefit of the billionaire/military-contractor class. Aliens literally need NOTHING from humans, or Earth. All of Earths resources can be found throughout the cosmos in practically unlimited quantities, and war is nothing more than a waste of those resources. If we were at war with aliens, we would lose before we even knew how to respond to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The president, and other heads-of authority are completely in the dark about all of this. It is considered \"need to know\" information. And the President, head of the CIA, etc, are usually not in the \"need to know\" group. These military projects exist without ANY government/public oversight, and are therefore operating extra-constitutionally (illegally). Therefore, anyone involved is not beholden to their security oaths if they desire to leak the information.\n",

It has a very different meaning and connotation than \"inter-dimensional being\" when used in context of this cconversation. I think one of the big hurdles in trying to grok dimensions is that we humans have very limited perception or real-life understanding of dimension. If we talk about a worm-hole we soft of get the gist - a \"hole\" in space that you can use to travel \"isntantly\" between two arbitrarily distant points. That can be considered as a form of interdimensional travel, but the doesn't make the traveler an \"inter--dimensional being\" and it surely doesn't make them a demon. The same problem exists when speculating on faster than light travel via mass reduction and timespace warping. If it is possible to minimize (or eliminate mass) and if it is possible to warp spacetime to create a moveable spacetime \"bubble\" then you would be able to travel arbitrarily large distance in arbitrarily short amounts time. But again, that would not make you a demon.\n\nModern physics is a funny thing, because 100 years ago it was \"fantasy\" and 100 years from now it will be history. We aren't done learning about how the universe works and what kinds of machines can be made to interact with it.",

Even Isaac Newton predicted there would be some \"end of the world\" change thing happening in 2060, which is pretty close to now in the grand scheme of things.  Other sources that predict a shift soon: Researchers like David Wilcock, David Icke, Kerry Cassidy, ET contactees like Alex Collier, Tolec, Corey Goode, Simon Parkes. Channelers like Laura Knight-Jadczyk, Darryl Anka, Dolores Canon. The list goes on and on. Many of these sources can be pretty hostile towards each other, but they all agree that there's some magical shift to a higher dimension of existence happening. This phenomena, true or not is rather interesting. Either it's happening or there is some conspiracy to make people think it's happening.\n\nBut personally, having followed this type of fringe information for many years, I've grown quite jaded and cynical. They are constantly making predictions that don't come true. This shift was supposed to happen in the 80's according to old-schoolers like Edgar Cayce.... then it was supposed to be 1999, then 2012, the date is always getting pushed off. Given that, there's little reason to keep taking them seriously.\n\nIf there are ETs watching out for us and helping us, why is there not a shred of repeatable empirical evidence? Why don't they present themselves and communicate with us like adults, like equals? All the excuses like \"it would scare peepul\" are empty nonsense.\n\nI appreciate the positive, hopeful sentiment, but the world doesn't need more empty fluff-bunny love-and-light drivel about invisible things are supposedly happening, when people have enough concrete mundane problems flooding our real reality.",

            "body": "Just remember classic Clinton methodology:\n\nThe Clintons (knowing how damaged they are) tried to project scandals they had onto their opponent. (They've always done this.) After Hillary had her seizure on camera, she had her friends in the media run stories asking about Trump's health. (Anyone remember that? See CNN's article \"Clinton's Health Fine, But What About Trump?\" http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-health/) Likewise with Hillary's illegal campaign funding paid for by foreign heads of state [not only a violation of FEC regulations, but an actual violation of the law), Hillary tried to distract from her Saudi and Moroccan benefactors by crafting the whole \"Trump is a Putin agent\" narrative. \n\nAnother example of this phenomenon was exemplified by Bill's decades of rapes. In a bid to try and neutralize that issue, Clinton surrogates paid women within the last 3 weeks of the campaign to claim Trump groped them. Wikileaks busted out the Craig's List ads that the Clinton Foundation put out months before for actresses. They straight-up said that it was to play the part of a \"Trump-victim\". \n\nSeveral of the women backed out after they initially agreed to participate (and one of them [a former contestant on the \"Apprentice\"] admitted that Gloria Allred offered her $500,000 to claim that Trump groped her. Google it.)\n\nBut this whole enterprise was undertaken to confuse people who weren't paying close attention, and to make Trump disinclined to mention Bill's decades of rapes.\n\nNotice how after the election all of Trump's accusers vanished in the mist?\n\n(Bill's haven't.)\n\nThe same phenomenon was in play with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. After it came out that Epstein wasn't just a close Clinton friend, but that he came up with the idea for the Clinton Foundation (and was a co-founder), the Clintons knew they had a problem. News stories were breaking about Bill taking 26 flights with Epstein to Rape Island. (Hillary, it later developed, took 6.) As even the mainstream media was reporting on Epstein being the chief architect behind the Clinton Foundation (which is significant as hell when you learn later about Pizzagate and its pedophile dimension) the Clintons had to try and silence Trump about it.\n\nMethod?\n\nJust as in every other one of their distraction gambits, they tried to do what psychologists call \"Projection\". They accused Trump of being the one who was friendly to Epstein because he was one of 10,000,000 people Trump knew back in New York. But Trump only knew him casually (meeting the convicted pedophile only a handful of times) when both men attended charity dinners, along with Snoop Dogg, Mohammed Ali and Mike Tyson.\n\nJust as Trump (as a showman) says diplomatic things about every celebrity and billionaire he knows, he said something about Epstein (before his pedophile scandal broke) like, \"Yeah, I met him once. He's a nice guy.\"\n\nThe Clinton team ran with that, and tried to spin it into \"See? Trump is buddies with Epstein, too. Just like the Clintons.\"\n\nExcept he's not.\n\nEpstein has zero to do with Trump's businesses (in stark contrast to his role in the Clinton Foundation as co-founder). See article \"Billionaire sex offender Epstein once claimed he co-founded Clinton Foundation\": http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/06/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-once-claimed-co-founded-clinton-foundation.html\n\nAnd Epstein was never a personal friend, or confidant of Trump's.\n\nThe two men (as fellow billionaires) would occasionally be at the same charity fundraisers or dinners. (Trump would occasionally run into him like he occasionally ran into Bill Gates, or radio shock-jock Howard Stern, or Willis from \"Diff'rent Strokes\".)\n\nBut as for Trump and Epstein, they never buddied around on a personal basis, nor is there any record of Trump ever riding on Epstein's airplane. (Why would he? Trump has his own private jet.)\n\nAs I said: Wikileaks has all of Trump's personal information, and they straight-up said that there are no bombshell secrets about Trump. He was a hyper-busy [therefore hyper-boring] private citizen.\n\nWith his 592 businesses and hit TV show, he didn't have the leisure time of the Clintons to attend Spirit Cooking dinners, and attending seances to raise the ghosts of Eleanor Roosevelt or Gandhi. \n\nBasically, the contrast between Trump and Hillary was that Trump worked for a living. Hillary used the government to enrich herself, and (according to Wikileaks) worked roughly an hour a day . . . when she showed up at all.\n\nOne person's schedule was jam-packed, and the other had lots of leisure time for stupid bullshit and perversion.\n\nIn summation: Trump made his wealth the old-fashioned way: In the private sector, by making things: Buildings, golf courses, hotels, etc. Hillary made her wealth through creating a racketeering organization packed with pedophiles, who threw pedophile parties (using Clinton influence to get heads of state and powerful people to attend) whereby they filmed them and blackmailed them. These blackmailed politicians would then steer lucrative contracts to friends of the Clinton Foundation (who would then give a cut . . . a service fee . . . to the Clintons.) The Foundation was not just tied into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (and thousands of other children), but into the pedophile scandals that rocked Washington DC [with Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert] to the pedophile scandals that hit the UK, the Netherlands, and most recently Norway. (Google the stories from last week, regarding Norway.) Heads of state in Italy, France, and a number of other countries are also implicated (but thus far have managed to stay ahead of the shitstorm). But just barely. As new developments emerge every day, they get more and more nervous (and more and more suspicious deaths are occurring as these people try to cover their tracks). But make no mistake: The \"Clinton\" Foundation is not really the *Clinton* Foundation. It's the Epstein Foundation, with Bill and Hillary as front people because they had access to powerful people and a massive rolodex. The Foundation was actually Epstein's idea, and it was Epstein who provided the initial lawyers and paperwork to put it together. The Clintons are probably as blackmailed as the other heads of state, with pedophiles Epstein and John Podesta being the real powers behind the throne.",

Tesla is known to have wheels where a triangle would reveal which 3 numbers were connected in some way.\n\nBasically what I am trying to say from my outside perspective is this.\n\nFor example if you were to change the amount of single digits to 6, (as in it would go 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 20 21, ect.)\n\nWhen changed into that format, every prime number would end in 1 or 5.\n\nI am down this rabbit hole far enough where I will tell you what I know in hopes you leading you closer to what Tesla knew.\n\nGravity isn't real. There is an electric force pushing us all down. Wherever our humanity goes it kills everything. Our entire universe is made of energy, it never dies, it's not possible. Free energy is a real thing. Free energy flying machines as well.\n\nBasically the world of occult is knowing how to manipulate others. Everyone has been manipulated so hard it's hard to even answer the questions relating to the occult in fear of striking a cord in people. The occult ties into other things like hypnotism. Very strange things happen with the mind and how you can make it affect other people. For example, Charles Manson.\n\nIt is extremely easy to brainwash people which is why I'm weary.\n\nGod is a real thing and it's the universe. The farther you get down the path of truth the more it makes sense. Seemingly Tesla was all the way. The universe listens to you, to my knowledge it's how I've gotten this far. We will find out in the future if the universe really is leading me because I don't know what's even farther than this.\n\n9 is the key to the universe because of various reasons.\n\nThe way Tesla thought more so was on the lines of simple maths and patterns. 9 is a pattern it is not math like we learn in school. 1 4 7, 2 5 8, 3 6 9.\n\nIn my opinion it's best to see the world as a magic being and to play with it from there. To reduce things as science has it today is an imbeciles way of dealing with it. To fix a helmet you don't put the helmet on and blind yourself until you fix the issue. We are blind. I'll throw in more that I believe Tesla would have said.\n\nHoroscopes and the stars play a massive part in our beings. Our pineal glands give us our knowledge of the next dimension. To know when you are most active in the pineal you can look at the stars and your horoscopes because the stars are what affect us.\n\nTo go even deeper to give you all eyes to see I will shed more light onto things.\n\nIn the eyes you can see everything. All of your health issues and emotional issues are revealed in body language and in your eyes. Your eyes are a window to your body because your eyes represent your cells in your body.\n\nEntities are real but aren't in my opinion. Basically I am just writing you everything I know that is related somewhat to Tesla. The world is best used and described as symbols. I do not care what hillary clinton is doing positive or negative, she is Hillary clinton. Just as Hillary Clinton is a symbol and there are no words needed to describe someone we already know here on conspiracy.\n\nAt the same time how are you going to describe things in mass? It's hard.\n\nBasically the occult is various systems one being they create a symbol, for example in the bible it's \"The Devil\" or \"God\" and if you follow those symbols you can preform powerful things in your life by changing your frame of mind. Sadly all you are doing is changing your frame of mind.\n\nIf you are able to change your frame of mind to be perfectly in tune with all knowledge of the universe the answer will not only be obvious to you, but it will slap you in the face because it stands out so hard.\n\nAs Tesla said, he did not fail 7000 times, he found out 7000 ways it does not work. That shows the type of person he is.\n\nIf you are a man of symbolism, as I am, you can simply say, all of X I'm not going to listen to because of Y. If you do that enough you will be left with very few things to trust. Some people hate that, but I love it because it takes you right down to the grind.\n\nI have eyes but being able to invent anything Tesla had is far out of reach in my opinion because of modern day finance.\n\nIf you are going to dig deep for truth I suggest you study the occult a lot. Think of a lot of ideas. The most truthful thoughts are ridiculed in my opinion.\n\nGood luck, I suggest you read his books but even then you have to remember he likely didn't expect the world to be so scrambled today. He bashed science 100 years ago, today it's even worse, don't forget it.\n\nI don't believe in outer space at all, and neither did Tesla I don't believe. I believe we live inside of a realm, likely there is a firmament above our heads. The north star never moves, everything around it spins nonstop. I hope this has been a good delve for someone looking into the occult.\n\nJust for clarity, I am not sure if those beings are real or not, because I have had some very vivid experiences, awake, and asleep. Either way, nothing is here to harm you, we are here to experience. Peace and love good luck.",

            "body": "Child abuse has many aspects.\n\nTraumatize a child before the age of 6, and it will not become the child it genetically would have expressed.\n\nChild abuse is a sophisticated form of \"human-hacking\", a way to tap into the individuals sub-conscious, and create a \"master-slave\" relationship.\n\nIt also makes the child's psyche incredibly easy to mold later on, and through consistent repetition of trauma, the child will have an incredibly hard time contemplating another way of life, and will make it very hard to escape, physically later on in life.\n\nThis is the basics of the human child abuse issue - the more sophisticated topic is how these monsters in this manner create a \"perpetual pool of resources\" - with enough humans to be self-sufficient in the long run - economically, genetically, through (selective) breeding, and on top of that, they have access to unregistered humans to satisfy their every desire, which also functions as a method for blackmail later on.\n\nThese people are a coherent and spiritually fused entity, who do not look on humanity with eyes you and I possess.\n\nBut the interesting part, is when a human being is perpetually abused, it never knows what true rest (of the soul) is, nor the concept of \"home\", like you and I do.\n\nTheir lives is completely dependent on someone other than themselves, which makes them extremely alert.\n\nSo alert, many in the long run develop \"abilities\". \n\n-Abilities are another term for alertness - much beyond what carefree humans normally possess.\n\nTheir alert-levels are through the roof, and because of a constant instinct for survival and potential attacks, they are mentally prepared for anything, all the time.\n\nDuring the First World War, this symptom was very acute for many soldiers, to such a degree, that many \"blew their circuits\" due to the extreme conditions of the \"modern\" war-machinery, constant hail of bullets, bombs and mustard gas - never knowing what was actually lurking around the corner - developing a \"syndrome\", which is just another word for \"symptom\", which is called \"shell-shock\".\n\nThis is niftly named \"post traumatic stress disorder\" in today's language, and is a way to describe how the human mind can break under severe life-threatening situations over extended periods of time.\n\nThe Human system has genetic traits that helps us escape a life-endangering situation - we have reflexes, a \"fight or flight-response\", help or escape and so on, which makes us very able to escape with our life intact if need be - but this response to trauma, or \"extreme stress\", is biologically \"designed\" to only last for a short duration - enough for us to either fight, or get the hell outta the situation.\n\nThe adrenaline which helps us become alert to danger in dangerous situations, are not meant to be in our systems more than a few minutes at a time. It quickly breaks down in the body, once released, but the kick that happens when a surge of adrenaline flows through the body, is the key to all this shit.\n\nFor the victims, they are overloaded through living under sexual abuse, physical and psychological/psychic trauma, and live a life in fear.\n\nFear releases adrenaline, and they become alert, but are unable to escape their predicament.\n\nBut the human mind is still a survivor - even if all seems lost. Due to extreme conditions, mental capabilities explore every nook and cranny of the situation, in order to somehow spot a god-damn light in the end of the tunnel - anywhere - anyhow - anytime. The mind may be slower than a computer, but it is infinite it capability - all it needs is time...\n\nFor the perpetrators, the adrenaline are mixed with endorphins and other endocrines as a physical response to their actions, which roots to the concept of control in a dangerous situation - and the power of having the life and fate of another human being in the palm of your hand is a complete chapter on it's own.\n\nSuffice to say that this gives another rush all in itself for many of those who choose to break this moral barrier - and this act alone, not necessary the act itself, but the stimulation of one's own nervous system in this manner is more often than not more \"animating and stimulating\" than normal everyday living and surviving of the work of your own two hands.\n\nNow I have laid the groundwork for my basis of the message I am trying trying to get across:\n\n-Quantum computers = (Abused) human beings.\n\n-Time-machine = A quantum-computer able to foresee what normal humans cannot - or in other words; \"How do we not get caught for what we have done...?\"\n\n-Quantum-Tunneling = A quantum-computers ability to look through time and space to another dimension/reality - or in plain words: visualizing another, and preferably better scenario than which you may currently find yourself in.\n\nAliens may or may not be an actual reality - but I have to stay with what I see, and what I know - and because of the spiritual connection to things, I can safely assume that Aliens are a term coined for humans with minds \"out of this world\" - and with a perspective so beyond normal human understanding, that it reflects the term it conveys.\n\nAny kind of \"energy\" term used in the culture today, derives from the very process of invisible information flowing between human-beings, causing them to relate to one another, and the environment, in every which way. Though Orgone energy is a very good attempt to describe the bio-electricity that animates us all. From my own perspective, if it is at all wanted; Orgone Energy is the closest term yet for how the Sun animates us, without getting into too much details.\n\nBlack Magic is a power-dynamic - always in play, and more devious in action than many dares to acknowledge.\n\nAnyways - this is my way of interpreting the scenario without too much mumbo-jumbo - because there is actually shit going on - so let's try and stay with the actual facts, and thereby narrowing the playing field a little by speaking the same god-damn language for once. Babylon is where \"The Gods\" fucked up the language - these times are no different.",

It is artificial; the computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected, and gravity is bleeding into this universe - that's what they call dark matter - so we are like a thought or a dream that's a wisp in some computer program, some God's mind or whatever. [...]\n\nThere is this \"Sub-transmission Zone\" below the third dimension which is turned over to the most horrible things - that's what it resonates to - and it's trying to get up into the third dimension (that's just a basic level consciousness, to launch into the next levels.) And our species is already way up at the fifth/sixth dimension consciousnally [SIC] (our best people). But there's this war, trying to basically destroy Humanity, because Humanity has free will. And there's a decision - which level we want to go to. We have free will, so Evil is allowed to come and contend (and not just good). And the Elites themselves believe they are racing, using human technology, to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization, where they are going to merge with machines, transcend and break away from the 'failed species' that is Man. [...]\n\nGoogle believes the first AI will be a supercomputer based on the neuron activity of the 'hive-mind' of humanity, with billions of people wired into the 'Internet of Things.' And so all of our thoughts go into it, and we are actually building a computer that has real neurons, in real time, that is also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures. So that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers, a true 'crystal ball.' But the big secret is, once you have the 'crystal ball' and know the future, you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control the future. And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know it, and a true \"2.0\" in a very bad way. Hive-mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone, knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us - not into some \"P.K.D. Wire-head System\" where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure - but because we were already wired in and absorbed before we knew it, by giving over our consciousness to this system by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system.[...]\n\nThe Devil, whatever you want to call this interdimensional thing that gives them advanced off-world technology, The Fallen One that's not of this world, is giving them advanced knowledge on how to construct these systems that have already been used before on other populations. [...] This is an interdimensional force that wants to influence us to build something that absorbs us and kills us, rather than the Divine free will we are given to build something much better that empowers the species. So the species is now making a decision about its entire future. [...] They believe we are this ugly, fallen, ugly species: we all need to be killed, they are the rich billionaires who are better than us, and they are going to merge with machines and become Gods and go to the next level.\n",

As a species, we discovered their presence mainly during WW2, but it has been covered up since. It is known that their visiting us intensified dramatically after we started detonating nuclear bombs. ETs have been seen deactivating and/or \"disappearing\" nuclear missiles, both in their silos and in flight, as they see nuclear bombs as an existential threat to life on other planets. Because of our violent tendencies, the greater good of the universe (ETs) will not currently allow any human being past the orbit of Pluto. We are too violent.\n\n2) Human beings, being the violent ape species we are, have shot down and reverse engineered ET technology, which includes but isn't limited to: Scalar/faster than light weaponry, faster than light and silent dimension-warping and inertia-shielded travel, highly advanced genetic engineering and nanotechnology knowledge (including the ability to \"grow\" \"robots\"), large-object invisibility, monetarily-\"free\" and limitless energy production, extreme bodily damage medical repair (including limb, spine, eyeball, etc regrowth/regeneration). The scalar satellites now in place, can also instantly detect when ET craft \"phase\" into visible reality, and can instantly shoot them down (this is why the average person no longer sees flying saucers/ET craft; they're being actively hunted by these orbital weapons)\n\n3) And the most insidious concepts revealed: black-ops government projects exist that violently abduct humans under the guise of \"alien abductions\" (using the aforementioned \"robot\" tech to convince humans, subconsciously that aliens are \"evil\" and to be feared). They have done this to laymen as well as heads of large governments, to convince them that \"Aliens\" will assassinate them if they step out of line. This is all in preparation of a coming false-flag hoax \"alien\" attack that is being planned to, quite literally, militarize all of Earth itself for the benefit of the billionaire/military-contractor class. Aliens literally need NOTHING from humans, or Earth. All of Earths resources can be found throughout the cosmos in practically unlimited quantities, and war is nothing more than a waste of those resources. If we were at war with aliens, we would lose before we even knew how to respond to it.\n\n4) The president, and other heads-of authority are completely in the dark about all of this. It is considered \"need to know\" information. And the President, head of the CIA, etc, are usually not in the \"need to know\" group. These military projects exist without ANY government/public oversight, and are therefore operating extra-constitutionally (illegally). Therefore, anyone involved is not beholden to their security oaths if they desire to leak the information.\n\n*Again, ALL of these concepts are first-hand witness testimony. Dr Greer and his team also disclosed all of this in 2001 at the National Press Club in front of the world media. And again, to be one of his witnesses, you must be willing to testify under oath to congress.\n\nDoes that about sum it up?",

            "body": "OK, I'll translate it. \n\n\u00a01. We begin this series of photos with the one that is surely the most impressive. It seems to have undergone a different treatment (?) than that of the next three photos. Is it a \"cigar\" that has been hit by a missile and is exploding at the surface of the water or a UFO that is coming out of the water and ready to fly? Note that no inscription appears on the original document in our possession. \n\n\u00a02. Here are the photos that came with the letter. We present them in an arbitrary order that seemed logical, however it is maybe not the most sensible since we don't know if it the craft is flying, going out of or going into the water...It is worth mentioning that one can read in transparency on three of the photos in our possession, copies of the originals that apparently came from an American military laboratory: On the left on top: OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH. NOT TO BE REALEASED. CT On the right at the bottom and hardly legible, a part of it having been erased because of time: Unauthorized Disclosure Subject. Security Certificat. SSN 674. Criminal Sanction. High definition photos are available on our CDR\n\n\u00a03. (Top) On this photo, we identify without a doubt a triangular-shaped UFO. It seems to be in trouble. (Bottom) If the order that we have chosen for these pictures is correct, the UFO here seems to now go sideways before plunging into the ocean... \n\n\u00a04. The next five photos show an egg-shaped object of large dimension that falls into the ocean. These pictures seem to come from another laboratory, SYGMA, about which we know nothing. Do these photos present a single and same event or are we dealing with two different events?\n\n\u00a05. (Top) The craft, which looks a lot like the one in the first picture, seems to be in trouble. Is it on fire? Does it come from the depths of the ocean or is it headed there? Despite the fact that its form perfectly resembles the typical \"cigar\" shape of UFOs, it is still impossible to distinguish more details of its structure. (Bottom) According to the letter from our \"anonymous contact\", the submarine was equipped with an analog camera, thus explaining the image overlay (or double exposure?) of the visible graduations (I'm assuming they're talking about the double crosshairs.)\n\n\u00a06. Too beautiful to be real, this \"cigar\" photo? We don't know, it might be the \"banana peel\" that would be used to discredit the other pictures of the dossier...Who was our anonymous informer? A reader of the magazine or a source wanting to share their secret? In any event, if we haven't been able to find these photos on the internet, maybe a reader will give us some information that has evaded us...\n\n",
