            "body": "Ill try my best, and at this point is purely speculation because to my knowledge this technology doesn't exist yet and if it does no way I would be told about it. So a little more in depth what we call resonance is us measuring something that appears to be in 2 places at once, due to insanely fast movement we are not able to measure yet. What adds to the holographic theory is these inconsistencies for example when we more or less \"take a picture\" through these scientific methods (mass spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, NMR), we perform these by measuring the energy level at a specific point. But say for example that in a compound that exhibits resonance shielding ( an electron that when measured appears to be surrounding the compound at all times) we measure at point A and point B and it appears to be at both at the same time. We say how is this possible? Our instrumentation and understanding of what an electron is just simply isn't there yet to try to quantify it, but it appears to be everywhere at once just because how unbelievably fast it is compared to something we are trying to measure it with. \n\nGetting to the point, anything moving that fast as an electron has to release the energy somehow (law of enthalpy), so these insanely fast vibrations are most likely emitting a very small sound (this is my belief and speculation), if someone is able to replicate/ understand the exact sound it is hypothesized that one would be able to more or less translate this into what the brain was thinking and potentially a specific memory. \n\nOn using light to stimulate parts of the brain, this is another really cool idea, that either the government is hiding the knowledge to the commoners or are simply experimenting on it themselves. The way a memory works to my knowledge is a combination of all the chemicals released into the body as well as our brains interpretation of the senses. When we think of a memory, we remember how we felt (what endorphins have been released), what we saw (how our brain interprets the light reflecting off objects through our eyes), and all of the other senses. It is possible that by more or less shooting specific lights in our eyes we could believe we saw something that we may or may not of. I have a hard time believing that we wouldn't be able to distinguish this from reality although due to all the other senses that our body receives input in. If we were in a tranquilized state it could be possible to have us believe we dreamed this or something along those lines, kind of like the movie inception. If you can make someone else think they saw something than you can tell them what to do.\n\nOn to finally the holographic universe, I checked out that page but don't currently have the time to sift through all of it, here is my view on the holographic universe. I don't 100% believe in it although I love thinking about the theory and the what if? My understanding is that everything that is in the universe can be replicated or more or less projected to us by a stimulation of our senses similar to us in the matrix. My understanding on the major reasons behind this theory is they are able to understand the origins of life (starting from nothing) and expanding through a series of very complex physics equations. For this to work they know the theoretical math numbers and that this certain thing referred to as dark matter must exist but we are not able to see it. I believe soon we will fully know what it is, science just hasn't caught up to the theory yet. It's only been a couple hundred years since we've known how to measure things using the speed of light and sound constants and potentially there is something out there better and maybe faster than light to measure. So this thing we are not able to see or measure referred to as dark matter is there and is hypothesized to be about 60% of the universes weight (energy) and that it is in a different dimension. So more or less I believe we are just waiting on being able to measure this thing that doesn't respond to light (our current best method) to be able to fully grasp all that is in the universe. \n\nPS Im just waking up so sorry if these thoughts are a little cluttered, feel free to message back if you want to discuss further.",

That's clickbait. It doesn't belong here. The deep state isn't involved. Period. End of discussion.\n\nIf you read the rest you will see why this is conspiracy-oriented. They are basically asking for people to come forward that feel like they had a spiritual encounter with alternative-dimension beings while using an a substance illegal in the US. No one is saying that is the case. I am leaving it open for discussion and there is a lot of quality information and conversation in this post. is there a reason you think it should all be censored?\n\n&gt; Now we are taking about the reptile world leader conspiracy, with nothing to substantiate that claim. This post is LITERALLY crazy. You lied, you manipulated, and you threw out wild baseless assumptions.\n\nWhat did I like about exactly? i was very forthcoming immediately in the submission statement. I can't help it that you assume so much based on so little information.\n\n&gt; If you like conspiracy theories so much, how about you spend time on the ones that matter? Not scientists wanting to find isolate consistencies in a very interesting drug. This is literally anti science bullshit.\n\nReal ones, like what? This was great conversation and even opens dialogues to things about drug reform and legalization. Yes, the real conspiracy is why is LSD, shrooms and marijuana still illegal in the US? Having a discussion regarding this topic is so threatening to you that you feel the need to call it anti-science? Did you read my other responses when another user tried accusing me of the same BS?",

            "body": "From - UFOs and the National Security State: Chronology of a Coverup, 1941-1973 - by Richard M. Dolan\n\n\n\n\"He was going up against an organization that was into much more than he could dream of. The horrific experiments conducted by the army and CIA at Edgewood Arsenal and McGill University, unchecked by any responsible authority, only got worse. By 1959, LSD was a sideshow compared with another chemical: quinunclidinyl benzilate, or BZ. Incredibly, this drug possessed effects far more profound than LSD and which lasted for three days, although effects lasting as long as six days occurred at times. Between 1959 and 1975, an estimated 2,800 U.S. soldiers were given BZ at Edgewood Arsenal. About this time, Jose Delgado invented a device he called the stimoceiver. This was a miniature depth electrode able to receive and transmit electronic signals over FM radio waves. By stimulating a correctly positioned stimoceiver, an outside operator could wield a surprising degree of control over the subject responses. Writing of such developments in a book about UFOs is no mere exercise in paranoia. Such tools of mind control, developed and used by the American national security state, show what these official branches of the American government were capable of. We must assume that inventions such as Delgado's were not merely drawing room experiments done for reasons of pure science. Inventions such as these had to be field tested. Against whom? Probably, as we have seen elsewhere, against hapless prisoners, minorities, and unsuspecting patriotic soldiers. It is maddening but true that the full dimension of this history will never be revealed. We shall never know whether an important or prominent person really died from an ordinary heart attack at just the wrong time. We can never know if someone lost their mind because of the inscrutable workings of their brain chemistry, or because the CIA made them lose it. Because America's official culture pretends that such realities do not exist, even stating these as possibilities places one into the crackpot paranoia category of public discourse. But the fact is that from the 1950s onward, and with increasing effectiveness with each passing year, America's national security groups developed effective, and wholly secret, means of disabling individuals as well as large groups.\"\n\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Manuel_Rodriguez_Delgado\n\n\n\"Using the stimoceiver, Rodr\u00edguez Delgado found that he could not only elicit emotions, but he could also elicit specific physical reactions. These specific physical reactions, such as the movement of a limb or the clenching of a fist, were achieved when Rodr\u00edguez Delgado stimulated the motor cortex. A human whose implants were stimulated to produce a reaction were unable to resist the reaction and so one patient said **\u201cI guess, doctor, that your electricity is stronger than my will\u201d.** Some consider one of Rodr\u00edguez Delgado's most promising finds is that of an area called the septum within the limbic region. This area, when stimulated by Rodr\u00edguez Delgado, produced feelings of strong euphoria. These euphoric feelings were sometimes strong enough to overcome physical pain and depression.\"",

            "body": "It's very interesting how the collective conscious creates our reality, independent of events in time. Philip K. Dick wrote a short story and then had the same exact thing happen to him in real life years later--then wrote an essay about it. We can manifest our reality through intent, whether passive or active. Someone writing about a leader on Mars being named Elon primes time to create a leader named Elon. The X-Files episode on a plane being flown into the twin towers, combined with the unconscious expectancies of a terrorist attack happening in the future after the bombings, primed all of reality to anticipate and expect a large-scale terrorist attack on the twin towers, which manifested itself in time. \n\nMcKenna had some interesting ideas about time, how it's not linear like we perceive, but events sort of cross over and reconnect and create events in time, like a line doodle swooping and intersecting and tangent-ing across a page. An event in 1970 can influence an event in 2000, and an event in 2000 can influence an event in 1970. It exists on a dimension we don't perceive, because we only perceive reality washing over us, rather than seeing the \"big picture\" of reality we live in. \n\nThis story probably inadvertently created the possibility for Elon Musk to become all hype about colonizing Mars, and lead the way. If this all sounds hyperbolic and crazy to you, that's fine. But time and events in it aren't as simple as we'd like to believe.\n\nThere is also the element of the potential for the human unconscious to \"unconsciously\" delve into, and perceive the future, as Phillip K. Dick talked about in his essay on his short story manifesting reality. Like we can dip into time and learn about events in the past, or the future, regardless of whether we were there. Like when events in fiction become reality, and not just vice-versa. Organic psychedelics also have the ability to allow us to examine time outside of human events, as Paul Stamets talks about with his vision of seeing \"a field of dead cows\" and then a month later being at a flood where there were hundreds of dead cows.\n\nSo, I don't think it's a \"time-traveling\" conspiracy or anything, or Elon's a robot, or a Martian, or blah blah blah--it's way more likely (as wild as it may sounds) that reality and time are much, much weirder than we know.

            "body": "We do not yet have a publicly acknowledged theory that fully equates our \"time-sense\" to some \"fourth dimension\" which we can access.\n\nBut we have a huge amount of science that skirts very close to it.\n\nThere are many problems that have to do with the \"access\" problem. In a standard Sci-Fi film we would just throw in a \"Time Portal\". But as far as you and I know, that's a fiction.\n\nLet's drive past the problem of not having a Time Portal and concentrate on what we would need in order to use a Time Portal safely and effectively, and what such a device would actually do.\n\nIn the movies there would be a big display with a Year and a Location. That would show you where the Time Portal is going to send you. The Date and Time serve as an index. They themselves are essentially artificially imposed abstractions. To see that, just consider why all creatures and most humans throughout history have never needed either a map or a clock to live full lives - it's just a convenience we have invented in the last few millennium. And I am quite sure God or the Universe does not need to keep a Calendar on His/Its desk.\n\nSo in order to use the Time Portal, we need to apply this arbitrary index that tells us where/when we want to go, or else we could go who knows where and when. I will call that a Time-Space Index (TSI).\n\nSo here's where things get interesting. Note we are not talking about the method to get a human to travel (or just view) a different place and time, but rather the TSI which could plausibly point to any given destination. Days, Years, Lats and Longs are UNKNOWN to atomic quanta.\n\nIf we could crack the problem of creating a valid TSI, then the technology of the Time Portal or the Time Viewer would probably be in reach, assuming we understand black holes and can create a technology that includes a \"managed black hole\". At this point, we would start talking about neutrinos and similar phenomena, which appear to be able to \"fold space-time\".\n\nBack to the TSI. Formulating a TSI would be the equivalent of triangulation in land surveying. If you know some points in a given field, you can find the rest. So this is where understanding a whole range of time-based sciences, from Geology and Paleontology to Ecology and Astronomy, and throw in a healthy dose of History and Genealogy and Archaeology (assuming you want to visit the past of the human species). Using such scientific \"databases\" we could possibly calculate the necessary TSIs to program the Portal to travel there.\n\nBut there's a catch. The Multiverse. If we accept that we live in a universe which includes an infinite number of sub-universes, all overlapping each other (which is a subject treated by other posters to this discussion) then the TSI has to also define which of many possible universes to pick for a given \"historical\" or \"future\" TSI.\n\ntldr; we're working on it...\n\n\n\n",

Now there are two factors of time at play, one for the oscillation and one for the relative motion. Another dimension arises, as the one dimensional particle or oscillation is now a wave consisting of two factors of time, and two dimensions. This two dimensional wave can interact with other two dimensional waves, as shown with electromagnetism (the 3D light you referred to), which is a three-dimensional phenomena.

The souls that are drawn here from other Dims/Dens usually just dive in and die here and the cycle for them begins.  Let me say... this is a path that rarely leads to the so called ET souls staying in this octave and Logos.  It may surprise you how capable this Octave of Creation is. Its not a place any entity can just drop into.  That is why the veil of forgetting between deaths is so useful.  you are not programmed by some thing out of your control.

            "body": "How possible is it that aliens started life here on earth as \"lets see what happens\" project. \n\n\nAliens much more advanced then our humans at their present state, would not have created so much pain and nonsense for a lets see what happens project. Unless a school child in another dimension we can not see and they certainly can not see us, create the Universe or Universes in a test tube like gas bubbles for fun.\n\nWe are simple tool makers. We just started to blow each other up with nuclear weapons. Our world leaders from east to west, are puppets of our monetary system, busy filling their own pockets, destroying, controlling and robbing small countries rogue nations with the excuse of terrorism, fear, while shaking their religious books and nuclear sticks at each other. We just started to send cargo to a very close Earth orbit and think that we are space fairing. Our drawings from the caves has just moved to canvasses we hang on our walls we are proud of.\n\nWe do not have a cure for simple flu and many other thousands of diseases like Plague, Ebola, Heart diseases, diabetes, Cancer yet. We are popping anti inflammatory medications like Ibuprofens with horrific side effects all the time. (it effected reduced my cartilage in my joints.) We recently started selling each-other snake oil type very expensive medications and treatments that can treat some diseases but certainly doesn't cure most. Our Doctors study nutrition only about 6\u201310 hours total. They have no incentive to discuss diet and nutrition with patients. Low insurance reimbursement rates discourage in-depth discussions anyway. Instead, they are forced to see three patients for an average of 20 minutes an hour.\n\nAt a cost of great deforestation, 46% global warming and using about 400 liters of water we produce a pound of burger patty. We are neurotic about leaky taps but spend about 1000 liters of water to produce 1 liter cows milk. We domesticate and \u201chumanely\u201d kill and eat other non human animals for their taste while ignoring that it is causing us many terrible diseases like diabetes, hearth disease obesity etc. We hate animal cruelty we have RSPCA or SPCA we love some animals as pets still eat them. Genetically we are cousins with the weed in our gardens (50% similarity) We are so very proud of our masonry that we turned it into a religion Free Masonry but we ignore and step on the simple spider that can build very sophisticated structures with practically what is coming out of its back side without any bragging. We destroy bees with our chemicals or for competition, steal their honey without hesitation.\n\nWhen I was younger and more ignorant than I am now, I did not have enough knowledge and did not know much about Darwin. I was healthy and blissfully ignorant reading lots of science fiction. Thinking that space was made of fart in a giant, camel like creatures intestines about to be pooped out. There was no Internet and search engines. I watched TV and believed the dumbing propaganda and all the product advertising and placement, believed it all! When somebody said, they are the chosen ones and they have a soul and the best, soul they will go to heaven and live forever. When they said they were promised a certain piece of land on the planet by the God, whom was acting just like an estate agent, I respected their beliefs. I watched the Exorcist and shivered.\n\nI thought they maybe right and I did not have a proof otherwise. Religion offered eternal life to death fearing humans it also gave them somebody like Devil to blame for their wrong doings and God to pray to for their health and wealth or blame for their misfortunes. I did not think religion was a tax heaven business that promised heaven and was being used for political and financial gain. I didn't know that Emperor Constantine declaring Jesus as the new God for the Byzantium empire at around 325 was a good political move. The masses were given a sense of superiority by religion against other inferior belief systems and making it legal and easier to eliminate them to have slaves paid or unpaid. We call them salary earners and workers these days.\n\nWithout question sacrifice becoming wholesale. The free demolition of building seven and the billions of dollars insurance claims received people are getting sacrificed by the millions. Shit hole countries and people who believe in an inferior, lesser God. They call it the war on terror and paid killers control drones from air conditioned offices to satisfy their egos, their banker bosses interests, their spirituality intact they collect their salaries and get to be called heroes.\n\nMore than 800,000 people die from cardiovascular disease each year in The United States alone. (This must be why government do not want to provide people free health insurance too expensive.) But they reduce the tax millionaires and billionaires suppose to pay to encourage the poor people to eat less and healthy.\n\nIt is now 2 minutes to midnight. I don't think they will wait for an asteroid like Apophis to do it for them April 13 2029. They are almost there. Most of them are so brain washed with the idea of an apocalypse they can not wait for it and want to induce it. Thanks to Abrahamic teachings. like they invented the cesarean section easy come easy go without the gut bacteria from the mommy's birth canal. sacrifice the immune system!\n\nDoes this species look like they are designed by a superior being an alien to you? \n\nMaybe they were trying to destroy Earth, so they genetically altered us to self destruct and do it for them.\n\nDo you think we try and communicate with or try to genetically improve Mosquitos? Yes we do. We genetically modify them to control their populations.",

In the context of esoteric teachings, that is what an evocation is.\n\nOf course the majority of people do not believe that there is more than the dimensions we are aware and/or especially those we cannot measure with our current physical instruments (thus making it objective scientific observation), but have instead been talked about and corroborated by hundreds of thousands if not millions of students of the mystical arts (especially in the east where the mystical teachings have been best preserved) and observed via expanding their awareness. If such dimensions/planes exist then beings that exist within them would potentially have non-corporeal forms and if humans could contact them, they could to various degrees influence this plane/dimension. All of this also means that no being is strictly limited to one dimension, the only limitation is one's contracted awareness. The implication is also that of a holographic Universe, molded by thought, awareness and intention.\n\nJust wanted to provide some short context for anyone curious. But yes, evocation definitely means what you have noted.",

            "body": "By \"simulation\" I don't mean as in a computer-based simulation, but that reality (as we know it) effectively acts as a consciousness-based simulation due to it not being the only one. Let's say that this reality that we're currently experiencing exists at a particular \"base frequency\", or that things based in this reality generally act within a particular range of frequencies, so that they are able to definitively interact with other things based in these frequencies. But the thing with frequency is that it's a continuum. There is no end to the rate of frequencies on either end.  \nSo, let's take for example the differences between rocks, water/air, and gamma radiation. The atoms that make up rocks vibrate at a relatively slow rate. It's what keeps the atoms in a fault uniform structure (depending on the rock) and stops the rock from melting at room temperature or running away by itself. The atoms that make up the cells of our skin have different vibrations. Generally they're faster, to allow for greater energy transfer between the atoms, and thus also between the cells. There's a relative fluidity to the skin, from the rocks perspective. At least with all those cells that carry out duties, die, then get replaced by other cells so quickly. But this higher frequency interaction, over the span of the entire skin organ, comes to form a pretty decent interference pattern which, from our human perspective, seems pretty solid. With air and water, their atoms again act at higher frequencies than both the atoms that make up the skin, and those of the rock. Between these three we can see that the immediate effect of the interactions between the rock and water or air are minimal. At least when you're taking the same amount of each and comparing them with each other, each as a whole, immediately. But if you look at their effects on each other on an atomic scale, or as whole but over an extended period of time, then you can see the fire extents of their effects on one another. Then we can look at gamma rays. Gamma rays are extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation. We humans simply don't have the biological equipment to pick up gamma rays. Gamma rays normally go straight through us with no problem. We have no biological way to register them, despite the high frequency response of the atoms that make up our cells, because when the cells come together and form systems and organs the result is that the organs and systems that the cells and atoms comprise operate on/within a different set of frequencies to those that the individual cells/atoms do. The only way we even know that gamma rays exist is through technology. Since we don't have the biological equipment to register them we needed to create a new piece of equipment that could pick up on them.  \nSo we can see that at the high end of things there exists phenomena which operate at frequencies that are too high for us to register in any natural way, yet still occupy the same space. That's an example of multiple realities existing on top of one another, yet due to their different \"base frequencies\" they don't directly interact with one another and generally will just do their own thing. Due to the fact that one reality has no immediate effect on the other, then from the perspective of one of the realities, it would be like the other is effectively a simulation. Doesn't make it any less real, as it totally is real within its own right. But from either one perspective the other just doesn't necessarily matter as it has no \"real\" effect on their respective \"reality\".  \nIn regards to your questions there, when we die we go to another reality. A higher dimension. The \"you\" who you were in this life doesn't cease to exist, as there's the data to prove that that respective existence existed through time and space. You could trace your path from death back to birth with the right equipment. But the \"you\" that exists now isn't just the you that you were in that life. You \"remember\" that you are the culmination of all the different lives you've lived *on top of* the most recent life you've lived. It's sorta like coming out of a video game and remembering that that video game you wasn't the real you, but just one expression, and that you are the culmination of all the video game characters and games you've ever played *as well as* all the stuff that was going on between playing video games.

            "body": "I\u00b4d say we\u00b4re in unseen territory here, science fiction territory, not even generally systemically dysfunctional (read: lawless) countries behave like this (e.g. mass school shootings are still largely unheard of in Mexico, Central America, etc..\u2013not even Boko Haram massacres the victims of the high schools it terrorizes). In the U.S., the states have generally all but literally abandoned their child citizens at the sacrificial altar of the Second Amendment. These are pyres of underage dead in whose preparation is complicit a political culture in thrall to the gods of a capitalist economy, the internal economic and ideological face of which is the domestic assault weapons industry. This is a form of jihad, of domestic terrorism, whose army is the coalesced force of an evident epidemic of adolescent mental illness in the U.S.\n\nYes, the catalyst/standard was set by Columbine, to be sure, but I would also submit that it was set by 9/11 as well. For that is when, in my impression, a metaphysical Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat/uncertainty principle-like ontology (in the colloquial or popular sense of the terms) took hold of the imagination of significant sectors and cultures within the U.S. In short, what has done more to destroy a belief in a commonly humanly shared notion of reality was not the left, through its \u00a8deconstructivist\u00a8 jargon, et., but rather the phenomenal/symbolic repercussions and effects of the surrealistic and \u00a8unrealistic\u00a8 reality of the 9/11 events per se.\n\nOne possible effect of a vitiated/debilitated phenomenological/ontological experience of reality following the aforesaid terrorist events in New York might even be a more generalized sense, especially among youth (where this psychology is already inherent and latent), that since reality is \u00a8not really real,\u00a8 because they are already living in a post 9/11 Matrix as it were, then the deaths they might be insanely tempted to cause are somehow not really real either. These attackers would then be beyond flat earthers in their denial of modern axioms of what constitutes reality. Phenomenologically and ontologically (via the continuing facilitation of life lived largely in the alternate dimensions of online space) they may come to intuitively view offline reality as a patchwork of idiosyncratic, essentially unbridgable dimensions between potentially other existent individuals, thus there is not one reality to them, but rather each individual exists in their ontological dimension, and thus the Other\u00b4s existence is already a priori in doubt, and so by extension the value of the Other\u00b4s life as well, because it is intrinsically less real than the in itself potentially unreal reality of the perpetrators themselves, per the strange physical/cosmological laws of the ontology they have come to psychology and socially (Orwellianly and Borgesianly) inhabit in late capitalist-stage American society.\n\nIndeed, and in short, perhaps, for the above speculated reasons, the subliminal temptation for the mass murder of their companions and contemporaries lies, perversely and in a phenomenon which was ironically quite inversely lived by Dostoevsky, in an affinity with so-called the Schrodinger\u2019s cat phenomenon (alternatingly and almost literally exemplifying the mystical paradoxical assertion of being alternatively within the span of microseconds dead in life/living in death, with the very foundations of quotidian, lived reality itself being somehow inexorably, necessarily and materially, not just metaphysically, undermined once the implications of such a phenomenon are sufficiently understood).\n\nDostoevsky\u00b4s description of his Schrodingerian reprieve, of his unspairing experience of Death-in-Life and Life-in-Death in the span of a seconds: \u00b4\u201dAs to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,\u201d said the prince. \u201cI once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a prison\u2013I heard it from the man himself. He was one of the persons under treatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy, then he would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide. His life in prison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating\u2026There was a very strange feature in this case, strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. This man had once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime. Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment substituted; but the interval between the two sentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. I was very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and felt. He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary distinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of the experience.\n\n\u201cAbout twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the criminals (of whom there were several). The first three criminals were taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them. Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. My friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up. A priest went about among them with a cross: and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live.\n\n\u201cHe said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be living, in these minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last moment, so that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time into portions\u2013one for saying farewell to his companions, two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all about himself; and another minute for a last look around. He remembered having divided his time like this quite well. While saying good- bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday question, and being much interested in the answer. Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself; he knew beforehand what he was going to think about. He wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible, that here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three minutes he would be nobody; or if somebody or something, then what and where? He thought he would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes. A little way off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. He remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of light sparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes from these rays of light; he got the idea that these rays were his new nature, and that in three minutes he would become one of them, amalgamated somehow with them.\n\n\u201cThe repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea, \u2018What should I do if I were not to die now? What if I were to return to life again? What an eternity of days, and all mine! How I should grudge and count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!\u2019 He said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done with it.\u201d\u00b4* (The Idiot, Dostoevsky)\n\nIs this the intuitively \u00a8Schr\u00f6dingerian\u00a8 experience being pursued by not a few of the recent mass school shooters in America, the liminal/violent psychedelic mysticism of Death-In-Life acutely accompanied and even seemingly coupled or blurred with Life-In-Death, from which the untimely and all too fleeting, but nevertheless uniquely obtainable realization of the real and actual conditions of and dynamics in one\u00b4s tormented existence are, even if perhaps also inevitably maddeningly and dehumanizingly, finally and ultimately manifested and revealed?\n\n*Cf.

            "body": "Sure. I have a twin sister. I'll tell you The twin psychic bond is real. It's a thing. It's not 100&amp;#37; psychic bond or anything but I swear that on many occasions I knew she was in danger and full on saved her life. Like pulling her out of the way of a speeding vehicle when she foolishly ran out into the road. When we were little kids she was climbing a tree and fell with her foot stuck so she was dangling upside down. I was far away in the house and had a total spidey sense moment. I knew she was in danger and had to find her. I ran from the basement to her room on the 3rd floor but she wasn't there. I looked out the window and saw her almost a football fields distance away flailing around upside down. I got my mom and we ran to help her. By the time we got their she passed out/feinted. I climbed the tree and got her foot unstuck and my mom caught her as best she could. She woke up not long after and cried for an hour. After that I knew the world was way more mysterious than most people knew and honestly that my sister was kind of dumb/reckless/ I'd always have to look out for her... \n\nWhich eventually leads to the ouija board incidents that blew my mind wide open. Back in the 90's alot of girls and some dudes in my hometown went through a witchcraft phase. Most of it was innocent kid shit. Some of them were bad asses who would wear all black with black make up, dye their hair black. It was a fad. They were going around putting hexes and curses on each other. Playing ouija board all the time. Everywhere. At school, at birthday parties... then people thought it was cool to play in the graveyard... My Grandmother (Nana as I call her) still lives close to the graveyard, she's now 97 with pretty much with all her wits about her, she's this super nice wise old lady who used to read tea leaves for people. She was always open to the paranormal and spirituality due to her own life experiences, read the bible and all kinds of books. She still prays for everyone one she knows every night before bed. She's a total gem. Not really superstitious at all. She used to tell me and only a select few people that their was only three things she feared/hated/warned people about: Going to church every sunday/Religions in general (she'd go for weddings and funerals).  Aliens/evil spirits/demons. And ouija boards. Those three things she would only speak of rarely and always in whispers and never to anyone but close friends and family. I was staying over at my Nanas one weekend and a whole bunch of neighborhood teens decided to throw a party of sorts in the graveyard. Naturally being a teen and something of a \"party goer\" I went with my cousin to check it out. I didn't think it was cool or a good idea and really I found it totally stupid and misguided.\n\n I always thought of the graveyard as mine and my families turf cause my Nana and much of my Moms side of the family lives closest to it and we'd always play around and explore it and all around it. We found about 10\\-15 teens all drinking and playing ouija in the dark with flashlights and lights from peoples vehicles. We found and grabbed my twin sister and told them all they were idiots and should not be fucking around like that in a cemetery and left. Some of them had been my friends, most of them shunned me after that. Called me a chicken and shit. So we made my sister go home and I went to my Nanas to go to bed. I go upstairs climb into bed and all of a sudden I hear my Nana screaming bloody murder \"get away from them! Get away from here! AAAAA!\" Like blood curdling terrified screaming. I thought somebody was hurting her. I run to her room and find her asleep but thrashing, evidently having a nightmare. I shook her awake. She was in  a state of panic. Startled. It took me a few minutes to calm her down. She told me she had the most God awful nightmare she'd ever had, that evil demonic creatures were after her grandchildren and the kids in town. She wouldn't even describe it any more than that to me she was so scared. She asked me where my sister was and I told her I had found her out and about and that I sent her home. She was really relieved when I told her. I didn't tell her about my sis and the others playing ouija in the cemetery till the next day when I kinda put two and two together. My Nana is known for talking in her sleep but no one had ever heard her scream or have such a horrible night terror. If you ask me those idiots opened up a portal to some hell dimension or something cause things started getting fucking weird all over town after that. My Nana started having Nightmares for a quite a long time after that. All the teens in town around my age at the time (13\\-16 ) started getting heavy into drinking booze and doing drugs. Small towns can be like that but things were excessive and getting out of hand. All sorts of lunacy. Suicides, teenage girls started cutting themselves, teens getting their stomachs pumped after overdosing and/or alcohol poisoning. I don't know if it's all connected to that night but that's not even close to what fully convinced me that some scary shit was really going down in my hometown and likely the world at large. \n\nSo i'm sitting at home in the evening and the spidey sense goes off. Twin sister is in trouble. I ask my mom where my sister is and she tells me she's at her friends house but the phone line was busy for hours and she couldn't get through to call there and tell her to come home... So I volunteer to ride my bike there to get her ass home. So my spidey sense is going off hard. Like I knew she was up to no good. I had goosebumps and adrenaline. It was a full moon that night. I'm racing past the Catholic Church and this black cat just starts screaming and hissing as I biked close by it. Could be a coincidence but I think it was a bad omen. So I get to her friends house and I find the front door wide open, Loud heavy metal music pouring out from the house. So instantly I know that the parents weren't home and that a party was being thrown. I walk through the door and I could feel an evil presence. Honest to God, like a dark foggy haze of malice. All the lights are off. No one on the ground floor. I go upstairs to find 3 teens passed out in the living room. I can see candle light coming from the kitchen so I walk in, instantly right when I walked in I see three candles who's flames shoot up three feet high and go back down. At this point I'm like WTF is going on over and over in my mind. I get goosebumps just typing this shit. So I look all around the top floor (it's a huge house) I find my sisters friend (who's house it was) puking in the bathroom. I ask her where my sister is and she tells me \"fuck off loser\" and continues to vom. So the last place to look is the basement. 5 teens in the common area, three of them passed out on couches and the floor. I ask my one decent friend if he knows where my sister is. He's out of his mind wasted. Eyes beat read he gives me this look like I pissed on his shoe. I'm all WTF. He's usually the nicest guy around. So I turn to the other guy hanging out (me and this guy did not get along, were not close friends)... out of nowhere he just drunkenly tries to tackle me with all his might. I saw it coming and easily side stepped him, he goes flying over a couch, smashes his head through some drywall while knocking over a lamp and breaking it. So I turn the music off and hear my sister snoring really loud in her friends bedroom (knew it was her instantly, she snores like a beast). I open the door and find her passed out drunk, snoring like a demon, one hand on a triangle playing ouija board. i'm freaked the fuck out. I walk closer to her and the triangle spells out \"fuck you future\\_madness get out\". WTF. I run out of the room to get my friends attention, they had to see this, I wanted someone else to see so I knew I wasn't going bonkers. Every ones passed out. I run back in and the board again spells fuck you get out future\\_madness. It starts doing figure of eights, racing from sun to moon, going through all the letters, even does a 666. It starts spelling ZOZO over and over again. Then MAMA over and over again. I start screaming praying to God and Jesus and my sisters eyes open up and they have this sickly green kind of glow, she's still snoring. So I'm all fuck this shit and tap the triangle with my foot and it flies at the wall like I punted it. I picked my sister up in fireman carry and carried her like that the whole way home. At one point she wakes up and asks me what was happening to her, I said \"something bad and I'm taking you home.\" That night is permanently etched in my mind. After that my sister was possessed. Fits of rage. Suicide attempts. Drug and alcohol binges. She's sleep all day and party every night. Finally I had enough and decided to take action, not knowing what else to do I got a bunch of holy water from the church. I go to room where she is passed out, said some prayers, pleaded to God and the ascended masters to help my sister and poured the holy water on her. She shot up like something out of a horror movie. So I quickly hug her (pinning her arms so she can't scratch my eyes out) I tell her to quit partying, and start praying to god, kissed her on the cheek and threw her back on the  bed. Then I ran like hell.... After a week or so in bed she did a 180 and I had my sister back. \n\nAnd honestly thats just for starters. I scratched the surface. From here I'll keep it short and vague and expand on anything u might b curious about.\n\n\\-Prophetic visionary experiences on magic mushrooms are awesome magical and even useful. Mushrooms need to be respected and even revered. Same with ayahuasca.\n\n\\-Shadow entities/people are real\n\n\\-I worked for a German \"Chrisitan\" Cult, They are creepy assholes . After years of taking their shit I decided to fuck with them for being assholes. The boss their is a known tyrant Nazi/Communist SwampPig. Like a comic book villain. I feel it was my destiny to subvert and covertly undermine and demoralize them by subtly and overtly convincing as many to leave their bullshit cult as possible. it was a process that definitely drove me mad. \n\n\\-After that I was seriously attacked by shadow entities 3 times. One of them was intelligent and communicated with me telepathically after attacking me and scaring the shit outta me. Never been so scared in my life. I was approached by men in black secret service agents type agents regarding the cult. They wanted to know what I knew about the cult but I didn't tell them anything cause they wouldn't tell me anything they knew.   \n\n\n\\-8 times since messing with the cult I've heard/interacted with a really strange voice. Its the voice of a kindof sultry professional sounding older lady. It always comes through electronics\\- Usually the radio either in my apartment or car. It always says \"Say Hello\" So I say hello. Then it always follows up with \"Say Yes\". I usually say yes. Not long ago it warned me that the police would be questioning me about a picture I posted on facebook of me holding a gun. It came true. The voice never comes from inside my head. Always electronics. A friend of mine once heard it and it freaked him out so bad he barely talks to me anymore.  \n\n\n\\-Music is a powerful tool and even magical\\- For Good and Evil. Peace. Let me know what you think or if you think I'm bat shit crazy town banana pants. 0\\_o",

If you have to do it repeatedly (say, an injury for a TV appearance) it\u2019s harder because the risk of continuity errors increases exponentially.\n\nIf the injury is on an exposed area, like the face or hands, faking it long term would be almost impossible. Imagine having to apply a fake injury every time you went out. Eventually you\u2019d forget, or get it wrong, or the latex would fall off and the fraud would be exposed for all to see.\n\nIncidentally, I\u2019ve *never found even one survivable wound to the hands or face from any of the dozens of mass media shooting events*. It\u2019s extremely rare even to find such injuries to the lower legs or arms, which are also often exposed during warmer weather.\n\nIf we extend the scope of injured body parts to include covered skin \u2014 the kind of injury that is plausibly concealed most of the time anyway \u2014 then suddenly there are hundreds of examples to choose from.\n\nGiven how many rounds have allegedly been fired into people over the course of all these events, and with Vegas in particular, the alleged shooter firing over a thousand rounds DOWN onto the crowd, it seems incredibly unlikely that nobody would have received a serious but survivable facial injury.",

However\u2026\n\n&gt; \u00a0we only have the opportunity here on Earth to exercise our free will.\n\n\u2026the idea that we have only \u201cone\u201d opportunity to do ANYTHING seems pretty incorrect.  We have multiple - possibly infinite - opportunities to do multiple, possibly infinite, things.  That\u2019s the very nature of a holographic universe existing on an infinite, eternal basis.\n\n&gt; This is according to the mystery traditions.\n\nI\u2019m basing a lot of what I\u2019ve been saying on the mystery traditions as well - especially those of the East.\n\n&gt; After life we do not have the same power to exercise our free will and it is important to realize that.\n\n\u201cAfter life\u201d\u2026There *IS* no \u201cafter life\u201d.  There is no *after*.  Life is now.  Life is eternal.  Life continues.  It simply changes form.  There *is* no \u201cafter\u201d in life.  As such, while we might have different powers depending on our level of awareness and evolution, depending on our level of evolution, many of us may and often do have far greater powers and abilities after this physical manifestation than while we\u2019re here in the third dimension.\n\n&gt; One of the main reasons the Christ came down to earth was to give us the ability to control our destinies as mankind had become very corrupt and was not heading towards a desirable future.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Christ\u201d is but one tiny grain of sand on an infinite beach of valid perspectives.  It\u2019s a perspective that might be the equivalent of a freshman college student helping out some seventh graders - where we\u2019re the seventh graders.  \u201cThe Christ\u201d might be the college freshman, which means that while that perspective might be a bit of help on one level, no one should ever put too much weight on anything a freshman says.  It\u2019s only a freshman talking.  Take from it what works, but realize there are truths *far* more evolved and advanced than it.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s \u201chumanity\u201d - not \u201cmankind\u201d.  \u201cMankind\u201d implies a male-dominated, male-centric perspective of the human species.  This is male chauvinistic even if one is not consciously thinking that way necessarily, and it excludes the female variant - the half of humanity that is no less important than the male, and in many ways might have a greater stake at preeminence since it gives birth, while males do not.\n\n&gt; heinous acts have the power to prolong your after life in a hell dimension while you \"pay for what you have done\".\n\nHeinous acts don\u2019t just prolong one\u2019s \u201cafter life\u201d difficulties.  They prolong one\u2019s *in life* difficulties as one reincarnates and has to account for the karmic repercussions of their acts.\n\n&gt; Yes you will be reborn but you might be reborn in Africa and get hacked to death at 3 years old...you might have to be reborn as a fetus soon to be aborted, repeatedly until you have burnt off your karma.\n\nDying at 3 sound fucking awesome, to be honest.  That\u2019s no \u201cpunishment\u201d.\n\nHaving to live a long life in the United States dealing w/all the difficulties there can often be far, far worse than anything Africa can ever offer.\n\n&gt; I am only hypothesizing here but my point is that it very much does matter what you do here on Earth.\n\nOf course it matters - but my point is that it only matters on a *relative* basis.  Does it matter whether you stub your toe or not?  Hell yeah it matters.  It\u2019ll hurt if you do stub it.  However, it\u2019s not like you will live some sort of life in \u201ceternal damnation!\u201d If you stub your toe.\n\nThe point is that although actions matter, they only matter relatively.  It\u2019s all about learning and evolving.  Existence, again, is holographic.  That means literally that everything is everything.  You and me and your dog and the cricket in the ground and the atom in the air.  All are part of the greater whole that everything is composed of.\n\nSo long as *anything* exists, everything does.\n\n&gt; Your soul does not have as much free will as it does here on Earth.\n\nIncorrect.  The Earth is nothing but a *tiny* speck in a cosmos of innumerable specks, all of which are simply aspects of The One Identity that separated Itself out into countless specks for the purpose of having different vantage points and perspectives from which to survey Itself.\n\n&gt; This is a mystery tradition spiritual truth\n\nThe mystery traditions are nothing but a speck.\n\n&gt; not even the angels or the archai or the archangels have as much free will as we have on earth. It sounds strange but its true.\n\nAccording to one tiny speck it might be true.\n\nThere are a *lot* of other specks that are bigger and truer though.\n\n&gt; Angels are under the authority of higher powers and do not choose to help or hinder, they only do what they are told.\n\n\u201cAngels\u201d are simply ETs.  There are innumerable ETs in existence - some good, some not so good.",

            "body": "Submissive State\n\nArticle is titled \"Unwinding the Madness \u2013 Is It Too Late?\"\n\nAn article on waking up to the conspiracies surrounding us and how to transform yourself. I feel \"conspiracy theorists\" are represented as preppers to obfuscate our spiritual contingent. We're not all doom and gloom. As many have stated here before \"Interesting times...\"\n\n&gt;As more and more people are increasingly realizing, humanity is under a full spectrum attack \u2013 fundamentally on its health and well being, as well as its very basic freedoms of thought and action. The vectors are myriad as millions scramble to recover their essential health and stability as well as prevent further damage. Scientism is the new god of this age, an unquestionable standard of seeming truth that can be totally relied \u2013 re-lied \u2013 upon. A very sad state of affairs, as the cycle of humanity abdicating its very own source-linked authority is not just denied, but willingly surrendered once again.\n\n...\n\n&gt;By the very nature of this relative-unto-itself mutant matrix, the plan is not supposed to be fully identified. They, or \u201cthe opposing program\u201d we appear to face, seem to make concessions as to who and how many may wake up to what, but the continually morphing virus at this level of density or vibration is an animal all unto itself. It\u2019s only power lay in our agreement to engage it on its own low dimension, an arena truly conscious divine humans will never gain a serious foothold in.\n\n...\n\n&gt;It\u2019s a minefield to navigate, and truth manifests in many ways within almost anything, but this again points to the individual, discovering for itself what is truth and what is not. We share a collective conscious awareness underneath this, but again it\u2019s based on each individual \u201csoul node\u2019s\u201d degree of connectivity as far as bringing this greater awareness into being on our current planet at whatever collective level we arise to. Hence the profound power of the individual. We each influence and alter that entire morphogenic field.\n\n&gt;This is the profound truth of where true activism is based, and why it\u2019s been so suppressed, marginalized and denigrated. Please let that sink in. It is all about us individually, first and foremost.\n\n...\n\n&gt;My answer remains: it doesn\u2019t matter. We each do what we can however we are led or \u201ccalled\u201d. That\u2019s all that matters. That Lao Tzu was impressed to record his summary of realizations before he departed speaks volumes. That great masters, despite their seeming attainments, still felt compelled, from compassion for humanity, to share the liberating truths they felt they\u2019d arrived at speaks volumes, so to speak. That those professing there is no explanation nor description for Truth, the Tao, God or Source still endeavored to do so, is in my mind and heart the expression of the soul \u2013 compassion in the face of profound ignorance and suffering, however those challenges were derived.\n",

Thank you for taking the time to explain!\n\nIncidentally, I'm sure they didn't lay one block at a time in a long queue, but probably did a few at a time. I'd guess at least one on each side of the pyramid roughly simultaneously. I say that because it makes the timeline as stated much easier to swallow. The suggested 100,000 person workforce would surely be enough to be constantly bringing in new blocks and setting a few at a time, assuming reasonable organization efforts. \n\nI didn't want to make it sound like I was trivializing anything. In fact, I tend to think that people who suggest they would have needed some special kind of help (giants, aliens, unknown technologies, what have you) are guilty of this. It is a ton of effort to make something not only this big, but as you say, this terrifyingly precise, as well. People are capable of the most incredible things, given enough time. Your calculations are very welcome, they add a dimension to the conversation I obviously hadn't given enough consideration. But I don't feel like they really change that much, except the total time investment. I can't imagine putting down 2.5 tons of stone block every 2.6 minutes either. But, assuming they put one on each side at the same time, that's 2.5 tons of block every 10 minutes or so. Further, assuming it took them, say, 40 years instead of 20? That's still extremely impressive. The point is, I think it's reasonable to think it took them much longer than is often suggested to build them, than thinking they must have had incredible help, or access to mysteriously advanced technologies.

How about that whole clock business? you know, the fact that if you go at the speed of light, you age slower than if you stood on earth? NOPE That was actually Sir Joseph Larmor.

The bodies are barely cold and left-wing journalists are already exploiting these deaths to score political points against me. It\u2019s disgusting. I regret nothing I said, though of course like any normal person I am saddened to hear of needless death.\n\n&gt;The truth, as always, is the opposite of what the media tells you. &gt;I sent a troll about \u201cvigilante death squads\u201d as a *private* response to a few hostile journalists who were asking me for comment, basically as a way of saying, \u201cFuck off.\u201d They then published it. Amazed they were pretending to take my joke as a \u201cthreat,\u201d I reposted these stories on Instagram to mock them \u2014 and to make it clear that I wasn\u2019t being serious.\n\n&gt;Headlines soon appeared claiming that I was \u201cinciting\u201d people to murder journalists. This is wholly false. The only people whipping up hysteria about killing reporters this week were Will Sommer at the Daily Beast and Davis Richardson at the New York Observer.\n\n&gt;If there turns out to be any dimension to this crime related to my private, misreported remarks, the responsibility for that lies squarely and wholly with the Beast and the Observer for drumming up fake hysteria about a private joke, and with the verified liberals who pretended they thought I was serious.\n\n&gt;It is a demonstrable fact that the Open Society Foundation and other wealthy left-wing organizations have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars (maybe it\u2019s millions!) disrupting my talks, beating up my audiences and spreading malicious rumors about me. I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if this shooter \u2014 just like the last one at YouTube \u2014 is another demented left-winger. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s another transgender shooter, too, so the casualties are minimal.\n\n&gt;The Left celebrated the shooting of Scalise and regularly incites violence against Trump supporters. They are secretly delighted by the domestic terrorism of Antifa and they cheer on Maxine Waters when she threatens consequences for Trump administration staff going about their business in public.\n\n&gt;I made a private, offhand troll to two hostile reporters, who breathlessly publicized it and like vermin their fellow journalists swarmed to remind the world how much they hate Milo. If the Left was truly horrified by violence against journalists, they would have shown it in the aftermath of Charlie Hebdo. As you all know, they didn\u2019t.\n\n&gt;P.S. \u2014 You guys should decide whether you think I\u2019m \u201cdisgraced, irrelevant and over\u201d or \u201cso dangerous I inspire mass shootings.\u201d I can\u2019t be both.\n\nTaken from https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/posts/1194490660688827",

I fully admit that some drugs are for a fun time. \n\nMJ: Experiences are commonly drummed up. The most intense thing you can experience is paranoia.\n\nMushrooms: I used to trip a lot on shrooms. Tbh probably way more than anyone should. With mushrooms atmosphere is important. You don't want to take them if you are in a bad place mentally. In the same breath if you go looking for a spiritual experience you may find it or convince yourself of it. \n\nMushrooms are mostly a mental trip/perception trip rather than visual. More than anything time plays games with you ex. a minute can seem like hours. Physical sensations are also different. Swimming or taking a shower is well very different lol\n\nimo every time you trip on mushrooms it is like flipping the breaker box of your mind. It changes your personality. I wouldn't say in a bad way but things like your sense of humor change a little bit each time you trip.\n\nTo really get the full blown mushroom experience you need to push yourself to the limit. My most intense experience was with a 14 grams of very potent mushrooms. Really... no one should do that. To even consider doing that you should be very familiar with tripping(a normal dosage of average mushrooms is 1.75-3.5 grams of average mushrooms). Everything was so different but familiar. There was an overwhelming feeling of never coming down. You get that sometimes with mushrooms but it was more \"this is my life now\" than \"never coming down\". Basically a general acceptance that from now on things might be different for good.\n\n\nSalvia/Peyote/DMT etc: This stuff is more than just tripping. It takes you to another dimension/universe. A user can expect every type of hallucination imaginable. Honestly, I think these drugs really do take someone somewhere else or let you experience things that are hidden to everyone else. I only tried salvia. Partly because there are some places you don't want to go. \n\nHopefully my ramblings help you understand this stuff a bit more.",

It would be impossible to know for sure, but I truly believe I lived through an entire past life during a DMT experience. I was born, grew up, had a family; the whole deal. My last moment before coming back; I was lying in a bed surrounded by my family before I took my last breath, closed my eyes, and then opened MY eyes and was back in my own time....dimension or whatever. \n\nWhen you first \"break through\" it feels like you're in a sort of dark wormhole moving towards something in the distance. Before you know it, you are face to face with a never-ending veil or curtain. For me it has always appeared more like a fabric of infinite colors constantly moving and changing. But its really just energy like light, and when you combine the spectrum of light you get white. Maybe the mode taken to arrive at this \"veil\" determines how much of it one can perceive. So whereas I'm actually separating myself from my material self and able to see the \"other side\" in full detail, someone on the brink of death is still fighting to remain in their physical form and limited by its perceptions.\n\nJust my 2 cents on why I think this type of knowledge is extremely important and yet severely undervalued in our society. We are so afraid of death and yet it is the one experience that we all get to share. Out of the fear of death billions cling to religions that have kept humanity stagnant for millenia. We have multiple plants on earth that can let us explore this \"heavenly\" realm that the devout seek. And yet those followers will persecute any who use \"god given plants\" to try to experience \"god\" in the same way the ancients did. \n\nFor me, the war on drugs is probably the biggest conspiracy of them all. You see governments all over taking advantage of the lucrative black market drug trade with opium, coca, and the ever expanding list of synthetics. There are pharma companies constantly trying to create and improve uppers and downers. The elite are constantly glorified for abusing them. Hollywood and the music industry constantly glorifies them. But just like with the medical establishment, you cant be allowed things that could make you healthy, independent people. Why cure a lifelong patient? Why give someone a mushroom or dmt treatment to help them feel whole and content, when you can sell them meth or heroin for every day of their lives? Why bring down our preconceptions and misjudgments and hatred when you can create and us vs them mentality so there are always splintered factions of humanity to rule over? ",

Things as weird as that keep happening almost on a daily basis. \n\nThe weird stuff with the Saudis recently, the amount of \u201cgroups\u201d driving a wedge between virtually every facet of most people\u2019s lives, antifa, BLM, us nazis, the quadrillion genders, the sexual accusations, media bias, the rich and famous falling, \u201ckids\u201d put on the frontlines of political wars, censorship, crypto currencies, fucking pentagon all but admitting aliens are real, satanic panic, new age and religious propaganda, and on and on and on. \n\nIt feels fucking surreal. It feels like things keep building up day by day. It\u2019s a subconscious tension that is omnipresent. We don\u2019t know leading to what, but we all feel it. The world is getting weirder, people much too sensitive, shit\u2019s going down. I grow nervous an almost imperceptible every day. \n\nThe general public is influenced by all that weird shit. I see it every day at work, with friends, out and about just paying attention to what people discuss. They adopt the terms, they believe the lies, they choose a side.\n\nI am not hopeful for the future, friends. ",

            "body": "Lets pretend: How possible is it that aliens started life here on earth as \"lets see what happens\" project. \n\n\nAliens much more advanced then our humans at their present state, would not have created so much pain and nonsense for a lets see what happens project. Unless a school child in another dimension we can not see and they certainly can not see us, create the Universe or Universes in a test tube like gas bubbles for fun.\n\nWe are simple tool makers. We just started to blow each other up with nuclear weapons. Our world leaders from east to west, are puppets of our monetary system, busy filling their own pockets, destroying, controlling and robbing small countries rogue nations with the excuse of terrorism, fear, while shaking their religious books and nuclear sticks at each other. We just started to send cargo to a very close Earth orbit and think that we are space fairing. Our drawings from the caves has just moved to canvasses we hang on our walls we are proud of.\n\nWe do not have a cure for simple flu and many other thousands of diseases like Plague, Ebola, Heart diseases, diabetes, Cancer yet. We are popping anti inflammatory medications like Ibuprofens with horrific side effects all the time. (it effected reduced my cartilage in my joints.) We recently started selling each-other snake oil type very expensive medications and treatments that can treat some diseases but certainly doesn't cure most. Our Doctors study nutrition only about 6\u201310 hours total. They have no incentive to discuss diet and nutrition with patients. Low insurance reimbursement rates discourage in-depth discussions anyway. Instead, they are forced to see three patients for an average of 20 minutes an hour.\n\nAt a cost of great deforestation, 46% global warming and using about 400 liters of water we produce a pound of burger patty. We are neurotic about leaky taps but spend about 1000 liters of water to produce 1 liter cows milk. We domesticate and \u201chumanely\u201d kill and eat other non human animals for their taste while ignoring that it is causing us many terrible diseases like diabetes, hearth disease obesity etc. We hate animal cruelty we have RSPCA or SPCA we love some animals as pets still eat them. Genetically we are cousins with the weed in our gardens (50% similarity) We are so very proud of our masonry that we turned it into a religion Free Masonry but we ignore and step on the simple spider that can build very sophisticated structures with practically what is coming out of its back side without any bragging. We destroy bees with our chemicals or for competition, steal their honey without hesitation.\n\nWhen I was younger and more ignorant than I am now, I did not have enough knowledge and did not know much about Darwin. I was healthy and blissfully ignorant reading lots of science fiction. Thinking that space was made of fart in a giant, camel like creatures intestines about to be pooped out. There was no Internet and search engines. I watched TV and believed the dumbing propaganda and all the product advertising and placement, believed it all! When somebody said, they are the chosen ones and they have a soul and the best, soul they will go to heaven and live forever. When they said they were promised a certain piece of land on the planet by the God, whom was acting just like an estate agent, I respected their beliefs. I watched the Exorcist and shivered.\n\nI thought they maybe right and I did not have a proof otherwise. Religion offered eternal life to death fearing humans it also gave them somebody like Devil to blame for their wrong doings and God to pray to for their health and wealth or blame for their misfortunes. I did not think religion was a tax heaven business that promised heaven and was being used for political and financial gain. I didn't know that Emperor Constantine declaring Jesus as the new God for the Byzantium empire at around 325 was a good political move. The masses were given a sense of superiority by religion against other inferior belief systems and making it legal and easier to eliminate them to have slaves paid or unpaid. We call them salary earners and workers these days.\n\nWithout question sacrifice becoming wholesale. The free demolition of building seven and the billions of dollars insurance claims received people are getting sacrificed by the millions. Shit hole countries and people who believe in an inferior, lesser God. They call it the war on terror and paid killers control drones from air conditioned offices to satisfy their egos, their banker bosses interests, their spirituality intact they collect their salaries and get to be called heroes.\n\nMore than 800,000 people die from cardiovascular disease each year in The United States alone. (This must be why government do not want to provide people free health insurance too expensive.) But they reduce the tax millionaires and billionaires suppose to pay to encourage the poor people to eat less and healthy.\n\nIt is now 2 minutes to midnight. I don't think they will wait for an asteroid like Apophis to do it for them April 13 2029. They are almost there. Most of them are so brain washed with the idea of an apocalypse they can not wait for it and want to induce it. Thanks to Abrahamic teachings. like they invented the cesarean section easy come easy go without the gut bacteria from the mommy's birth canal. sacrifice the immune system!\n\nDoes this species look like they are designed by a superior being an alien to you? \n\nMaybe they were trying to destroy Earth, so they genetically altered us to self destruct and do it for them.\n\nDo you think we try and communicate with or try to genetically improve Mosquitos? Yes we do. We genetically modify them to control their populations.",

            "body": "Haha! What planet do you live on where Turkey is improving in those categories:  \n\n&gt;Economy, Military, Medical, Exports and Human Rights have all had amazing advances since 2014. \n\nThis is the reality just after the Turkish coup in July, 15, 2016 and thanks for illustrating the depth of pro-Turkish shills on Reddit:   \n\n&gt;https://turkeypurge.com/     \n&gt;151,967 dismissed*\n\n&gt;133,257\ndetained\n\n&gt;64,998\narrested\n\n&gt;3,003\nschools, dormitories and universities shut down\n\n&gt;5,822\nacademics lost jobs****\n\n&gt;4,463\njudges, prosecutors dismissed**\n\n&gt;189\nmedia outlets shut down\n\n&gt;319\njournalists arrested*\n\nThis is an old post I wrote that gives just a tiny glimpse of how much the AKP regime lies about key indicator indicators:     \n\nBut the Turkish government lies all the time and their GDP figure and economic growth figures are all lies. These are the games that the AKP plays with GDP calculations:   \n\n&gt;http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/opinion/gunes-komurculer/questions-regarding-turkeys-revision-in-gdp-calculations-107364\n\n&gt;December 16 2016 \n\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;With the new calculation method, on Dec. 12, some 80 million Turks got a nearly 20 percent boost to their average standard of living \u2013 on paper at least. T\u00dc\u0130K said the 2015 GDP stood at $861 billion, from $720 billion before the revision \u2013 adding $141 billion to the size of the economy virtually overnight. The growth over the previous decade now averages more than one percent compared to the previous calculations. \n\nAnd:   \nhttps://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/12/turkey-how-turks-became-richer-overnight.html\n\nIn 2006 the AKP liars pulled the same stunt:   \n\n&gt;Turkey revises 2006 GDP up 31.6 percent   \n\n&gt;The Turkish Statistics Institute (TURKSTAT) revised the country's 2006 gross domestic product up 31.6 percent to 758 billion lira ($526 billion), the institute's chairman Omer Demir said on Saturday. 2006 GDP was previously reported as 576 billion lira, he said. (UPDATED)\n\n&gt;...\n\nI will not included that link as the crappy Reddit automod deletes automatically all posts linking to that Turkish source. \n\nAnother good article where a Western economist, Erik Meyersson looking at freight traffic, energy consumption, construction permits, bank loans shows the AKP is likely lying with their reports of high economic growth, because it is not consummate with those aforementioned indicators:   \n\n&gt;https://erikmeyersson.com/2017/02/16/will-the-real-real-gdp-in-turkey-please-stand-up/\n\nA Turkish economist, Dani Rodrik destroys the AKP myth that Turkey is gaining ground economically vis a vis the rest of the world under their rule:  \n\n&gt;http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2015/04/turkish-economic-myths.html\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;First, let\u2019s dispense with some misconceptions about how well the Turkish economy did under Erdogan. As the chart below shows, Turkey\u2019s growth performance since 2002 (when AKP took over) has been middling. A 50% increase in per-capita GDP (at constant prices) is nothing to scoff at, but it is below what Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, Ghana, Indonesia, Philippines and many others \u2013 not to mention China and India \u2013 have achieved. (And no, Turkey\u2019s income did not triple over this period, as government officials claim.) \n\n&gt;..\n\nMore from Rodrik, as he points out when you compare Turkey to its developing nation competitors, not the developed world, Turkish GDP growth is anemic by comparison and Turkey is actually losing ground to its closest economic rivals:   \n\n&gt;http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2013/06/how-well-did-the-turkish-economy-do-over-the-last-decade.html\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;The Turkish government likes to claim that the GDP expanded by more than three-fold between 2002 and 2012. This is a misleading number, as it is based on the dollar valuation of Turkish GDP at current prices, and hence lumps both dollar inflation and the real appreciation of the Turkish lira on top of real growth. Calculated properly, real GDP (or GDP at constant prices) rose by 64 percent during 2002-2012, and real GDP per capita by 43 percent.* \n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;However, an important issue that is frequently overlooked is the conjunctural and comparative dimension. The last decade has been an exceptionally good one for developing countries as a whole. When Turkey\u2019s performance is compared to the average for emerging and developing countries, it hardly looks distinguished. This can be seen from the figure below.\n\n&gt;The figure shows that Turkish performance lagged significantly behind emerging and developing economies as a group. In the latter, real GDP rose by 95% compared to Turkey\u2019s 64%.  Real GDP in large emerging markets such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia all grew more rapidly than Turkey, as it did in many smaller African and Latin American countries.\n\nKeep in mind he is not questioning the official figures given by the Turkish government that much compared to Meyersson. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn conclusion get you be wrong and get more owned? Not possible, I don't think. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Revealed themselves as different things based on local customs\n\nThe worship of the old gods is still permitted. You must only worship God before no others though. Theres a Jewish rabbi that does this (I do too). God first. The others after. No different than Catholics worship of varipus saints.\n\nWe needed the things taught by these old gods to advance spiritually as a species before the true God revealed hinself to us.\n\nThere is no hell. There is a lower and upper 4th dimension where negative spirits go to the lower. This is where the \"down to hell comes from\"\n\nBut there is no endless torture other than being around other negative twats. God loves all his creations. You are welcome to go up whenever you absolve your negativity. \n\nI was raised Lutheran. High school I did the typical atheist edgelord thing. Senior year found Odin and went to war to gain favor and maybe go to Valhalla if I was lucky. \n\nThis is what ive learned between studying eastern, Hindu and native American techniques to kick over to a trance like state for meditation and a couple dmt trips.\n\nHumanity as a while evolved with the advance of the times.

            "body": "Let's take the senate. That's 100 politicians in office at any given time. Pick any point in time and name the ones who have characters that have been assassinated.\n\nI am arguing that mere character assassination cannot account for the phenomenon we see. An important correlate is my contention that Americans elect electable candidates. The campaigning cycle almost insures that IF they have \"assassinatable\" characters before election, they will usually get weeded out. This despite both money corruption and sex-scandals of any dimension. IF they are controlled by character assassination, and only a few actually get assassinated that way, we would have to assume that EITHER the majority are clean, because they clearly are not getting character assassinated, OR the majority are criminals and frauds who look out for each other to the extent of covering crimes (which could assassinate left and right) AND the majority of voters and party-members are likewise seriously deluded.\n\nI know it's a complicated line of reasoning, but it's meant in the way one might argue that Flat Earth cannot be true because a vast majority of astronomers have no interest in pretending. A vast number of politicians also appear to have no compelling interest in exposing themselves to potential penalties by leading \"character assasinatable\" lives.\n\nMy hunch is something else, and it goes like this. New politicians that come into office receive a bunch of briefings. In these briefings they are told certain things that make them act the way they do - and what they are told is convincing without blackmail.\n\nYou might be disappointed in my grand finale, but as a conspiracy theorist you shouldn't be. If we look closely at the actions of the political class for at least 20 and maybe 40-50 years, I'll just say this: whatever they are getting briefings on is UN-REPEATABLE. Our job is to repeat the things that MAYBE those briefings of otherwise clean politicians include. It also gives us a lot of freedom, not to know. If we knew for sure we would have to keep it to ourselves, or face quite considerably bad consequences.\n\nSorry for the rant-worthy retort - sometimes you get the whole 10 yards.\n\n",

            "body": "Material Reference:Treason at the air force command space Richard Lighthouse\n\n**Technology \\- Block All Microwaves**\n \n\n**A Faraday Cage that is properly designed and properly grounded, will block all microwaves and will block all V2K.  It will also block all synthetic telepathy, Artificial Intelligence signals, and whatever other descriptions you have heard.  The people that designed this technology for Schriever Air Force Base are not medical doctors.  They are engineers.  Please stop listening to medical doctors to solve an engineering problem.**\n \n\n**Your microwave oven is a good example of a Faraday Cage.  The microwaves in this case, are kept inside the cage, rather than outside.  In simple terms, a Faraday cage is a metal box or shell that conducts electricity and protects whatever is inside.  There has been a huge disinformation campaign by the CIA to convince TI's that an effective cage cannot be built.  Don't believe it.  A Faraday Cage is simple science and has been around since the 1800's.**\n \n\n**The history of satellite weapons is provided below.  All readers should familiarize themselves with this information.  See the technology tabs at TargetedJustice.com**\n \n\n**The Faraday Cage was invented by Michael Faraday in the 1830's.  A simple Faraday Cage is basically a box\\-type enclosure that will carry an electrical current on the surface and isolate the contents that are inside, from any harmful electrical effects.**\n \n\n**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday\\_cage**\n \n\n**We are providing some of the details, so you can make one yourself.  This information will be updated as we get more experimental results.**\n \n\n**You can make one at any size that you want.  We recommend one that is sized for sleeping, since this is when the US Air Force personnel at Schriever Air Force Base will increase the targeting on your brain.  Over a long period of time, the microwaves attack the white matter tissue in the brain, and cause it to deteriorate.  We know this from the MRI's of the U.S. diplomats in Cuba complaining of \"sonic attacks\".  A good Faraday cage will block all of these microwave attacks.**\n \n\n**The wood frame can be built from 2 x 4's that are available at HomeDepot or Lowes.**\n **The recommended size for one person is about 31\" X 36\" x 90\"**  \n **The recommended size for 2 persons is about 31\" X 48\" X 90\"**\n \n\n**The 31\" dimension is set by the maximum size that will go thru your doorway, if you build it in your garage.**\n \n\n**The first choice of surface material is a high\\-mesh aluminum wire screen.  This is NOT the aluminum screen that is available at HomeDepot or Lowes \\- the mesh is not high enough.  \\(Mesh is the number of wires per inch.\\)**\n **We recommend a 40 mesh aluminum wire screen, if you can obtain it.  24 x 24 mesh might also suffice.**\n \n\n**Some TI's have reported building a Faraday Cage using ordinary aluminum screen from Hope Depot.  At first, it appears that the cage is working properly.  Within a few weeks or months, the government criminals will install a higher frequency magnetron close by \\(usually on a cell tower\\), that will penetrate the aluminum mesh.** \n \n\n**One TI has claimed total protection using solid copper panels.  Some have reported that their enclosure shakes, although it blocks the microwaves.  This is probably am acoustic attack, meaning that acoustic waves are being used that vibrate molecules in the air.  Acoustic\\-Pressure waves cannot destroy brain tissue like microwaves.  This is different than directed microwaves.  Supposedly, scalar waves have been used, but this has not been proven.  More suggestions at CitizensAHT.org**\n \n\n**The second choice of materials is Extra Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil, such as Reynolds 632 and Reynolds 633 foil.  WARNING: YOU MUST DRILL SMALL HOLES IN THE FOIL AFTER IT IS INSTALLED, BECAUSE THE AIR INSIDE DOES NOT CIRCULATE, CAUSING CARBON DIOXIDE POISONING.   Carbon dioxide poisoning can occur within one hour inside the box dimensions which have been given for one person.  It must be ventilated by drilling multiple holes with 1/64\" inch drill bit.  50 holes on 2 sides of the box should suffice.  The holes are deliberately small to block the higher frequencies, that the Air Force will try to use.  Keep the holes in a small area \\- high on one side and low on the opposite side of the box for circulation.**\n \n\n**The total cost of materials is about $300.  It can be built using ordinary aluminum foil from Walmart.  However, this might be easily damaged.  Extra Heavy Duty aluminum foil is available from many different websites.  Reynolds 632 and Reynolds 633 are good examples of Extra Heavy Duty Foil.  The aluminum foil easily carries the voltage from the microwaves at 1 to 10 millivolts.  The frequency from the Vircator satellite weapon is about 3925 MHz.  The magnetron frequency from cell towers is typically, either 2400 MHz or 2550 MHz.**\n \n\n**Step 1.  Build a wooden box frame out of 2 x 4's, at the size that you want.**\n **Step 2.  Cover the box with aluminum foil, overlapping the joints, and taping on each side.  Be certain there are no gaps anywhere on the surface. Use aluminum foil tape or a very sticky tape and SEAL BOTH SIDES OF THE OVERLAPPING JOINTS.  The glue on one side of aluminum foil tape is not conductive.  Alternately, you can use copper tape that is conductive on both sides.  \\(Check it with a voltmeter\\) Any gaps will allow the microwaves to penetrate the box.  The government criminals will attempt to penetrate the box by using a higher frequency of microwaves that can get into small cracks and larger holes.**\n **Step 3.  The door seal is the most critical part.  The door must be designed so that it makes a near\\-perfect seal.  There must be continuous contact where the door seals against the box frame.  One method for the door seal, is to use a linear sponge material and wrap it in ordinary aluminum foil.**\n **Step 4.  Grounding.  Use a grounding wire that is #6 gage or better to connect to the aluminum screen or foil.  \\(smaller number means larger wire\\)  Home Depot may have a wire remnants section in the electrical aisle, where you can find this wire inexpensively.**\n **Step 5.  Ground Rod.  Connect to a good grounding source.  We recommend NOT using the grounding rod below your electrical box.  The criminals can remotely put a signal to the ground, which may back\\-feed your Box.  The grounding rod will be 3 to 4 feet into the ground, as a minimum.  CAUTION:  Get someone that understand electrical connections to help you.  Alternative:  Attach to the metal gas pipe, where it goes underground.**\n **Use a wire brush to be certain the surface is clean and makes good contact between the wire clamp and the rod.  Check it with a voltmeter.  Clean the surface with a wire brush to be certain the clamp makes good contact with the gas pipe.  Do not use the household wiring for a ground.  The government criminals will put a signal into it.**\n **Step 6.  Get someone to help you test it.  Get inside and close the door.  If it seals properly, you will immediately notice a reduction in microwaves.  The government criminals will try to increase the intensity of microwaves to penetrate the enclosure.**\n **Step 7.  Troubleshooting.  If you are not getting a significant reduction, there is likely a gap somewhere on the surface.  The door seal or the grounding clamps are the most likely source of the problem.**\n \n\n**Pictures and other details will be updated here.

The premise is that there are billions of stars and infinite space + billions of years of time, so **where are the aliens?** All you have to do is realize that the premise is wrong: that space is not what they say it is, and there actually really aren't billions of stars like our Sun, there really isn't infinite space, and their model of the creation (Big Bang) is wrong, and the age of the Earth and universe wrong as well. So there you go: there are no aliens coming from out there, because the universe model is wrong, and there *isn't anything out there.* Simple.\n\nCan there be beings from other realms of this reality? Of course. The \"little green men\" and other sightings could be from Earth just from a far away, forbidden zone, or other \"dimension.\" But so far in the Earth in this dimension, it appears it's just us humans here, but they (TPTB) have been ramping up a psychological operations to fake an alien invasion. In other words, there will be *people* in those saucers, and the aliens will be figments of a Hollywood imagination. Don't fear aliens. Fear Big Brother and his very real and very deadly monsters (brought to you by Disney).",

            "body": "It's a terrible analysis. Don't believe me? Let's take a look. \n\nAn analysis is a detailed examination of the elements or structure of something. Can you show me explicitly where you provided a detailed examination of what it is you're talking about? It's not in your comments anyway.\n\nRegarding your article: just because it's on Forbes don't mean shit. It's also a guest post. A guest post from  Alex Nowrasteh, who's undoubtedly left. He's also pro\\-immigration, which is pretty conflicting with the right in your country. So from the start we have a relatively low\\-quality post from a biased observer with an agenda. Great. Objectivity here we come. \n\nIn his post you see that he creates four groups for his analysis. They are Islamic Terrorists, Nationalists and Right Wing Terrorists \\(you can be a nationalist in my country without being Right Wing, but whatever\\), Left Wing Terrorists \\(that's a nice way to narrow the Left\\) and Unknown/Other. Before I move on, do you see the problem with this? He applies a different grain for each group. Why would you separate terrorist attacks into religious beliefs \\(only Islamic belief too\\) and political ideology? You do know there's a centre too, right? Where are they in his groupings? Where are the Christian terrorists? Environmental terrorists?  Jewish terrorists? The groupings make no fucking sense at all. If you were in any way decent at practicing science then you'd see the folly immediately. There's no basis for a strong methodology of comparison. Not to mention his research skills regarding statistics are abysmal at best. \n\nHe assess the terrorist attacks that took place between 1992 and 2017. You read the article, you know the story. So Right Wing terrorists have been ten times as deadly over this specific period than Left Wing terrorists. Funnily enough though, Left Wing terrorists have killed almost three times as many people as Right Wing terrorists since the start of 2016 \\(up to the date of publication of the article\\). So in actuality, at the moment, Left Wing terrorists are definitely more deadly. See how I make statistics shift my way?\n\nAnyway, regarding your last comment: the article clearly shows that Left Wing terrorism is more of a growing threat than Right Wing terrorism. Left Wing terrorism has been rising exponentially relative to other forms. So I suppose that's the problem.\n\nNo, that's not the problem. The problem is people like you who propagate and peddle divisive dialogues for your own agenda, an agenda derived from your narrow, biased analysis of the world around you. \n\nI don't follow a particular ideology. Representing the entire political spectrum on a one\\-dimension was never going to be a good idea. Besides that, you need both wings to fly my friend. \n\nIn terms of implicit and explicit global terrorism, the USA leads the charge for being the most malevolent and destructive force on the planet. From unsustainable consumption to extortionate production, from kicking in the conceptual front\\-door of nations you have no place being in to resource\\-robbery of more noble nations than yours, you are the bane upon this earth and it's all the better if you wipe yourselves away. \n\nAlas, this is not the case though. Instead we're left with insidious and short\\-sighted plebians like yourself, spreading your hateful and \\*very poorly analysed\\* opinions. \n\nDownvote me to oblivion. That's how I know I'm on to something",

If that's the case, flat earth shouldn't be ruled out. There are even wilder theories like the \"saturn moon matrix\" which carry the same core idea, with the added concept of \"loosh\" or whatever is being thrown around this sub lately (your body is an energy source being harvested by beings in another dimension). So there could be something more spiritual/biblical to it as well. Secondly, there are some interesting coincidence/phenomena with things such as the Sun being the same size as the Moon from our location of observation on Earth. Some things like that one just seem too perfect by design.\n\nAnother one is geocentrism. It has been argued for millennia whether or not the Earth is actually moving, what is its position in the universe, how do the celestial objects in our solar system actually orbit each other, and why do we observe red shift everywhere. Hubble's observation of red shift suggests *everything is moving away from us* which Hubble claims puts us in a somewhat \"special\" place in the universe, aka at the center of it, and it may be that every place in the universe is in some way the center.\n\nSome links to consider:\n\nhttps://biblescienceforum.com/2014/01/31/hubble-does-our-galaxy-occupy-a-special-place-in-the-universe/\n\nhttps://www.theprinciplemovie.com/",

            "body": "'crazy' is stupid label; it's very purpose is to completely dismiss someone.\n\nEven if someone was ranting and raving to no visible person, maybe that person is hearing voices. I can't hear the voices, so I think, 'oh, must be crazy'. But that person is ACTUALLY HEARING VOICES. To them, it's real. 'Crazy' discounts someone's unique experience just because they're operating on some plane of existence the rest of us aren't. I can take a shit\\-ton of acid and hear voices and hallucinate, but I'm not 'crazy', I'm just 'on drugs'. I'm on another dimension of experiential reality. \n\nI just discovered Kyle Odom's manifesto...[https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2754139\\-Kyle\\-Odom\\-Manifesto.html](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2754139-Kyle-Odom-Manifesto.html)...if you read it \\(and it's a great read\\), you can see he's clearly lucid and articulate when he was writing it. This guy clearly believes, with every fiber of his being, that there are 'Martian reptiles' that walk among us. To call him crazy is to completely discount his experience of reality. I stepped away from that manifesto like, 'huh, well everything's so fucking crazy these days, maybe there are martian reptilians among us'. I don't even know what to believe anymore.\n\nWe also don't 100&amp;#37; understand schizophrenia. There are some indigenous cultures in the world where it doesn't exist...if we think it happens x percentage of the time across all populations, it should be there, but it's not. Also, documented incidences of societies where, after television was introduced, incidences of schizophrenia shot up. Some scientists think we evolved from a 'bicambrial' mind, which would essentially be schizophrenia. We all do have a 'voice in our heads', but it's OUR voice. We're constantly narrating our own lives to ourselves. \n\nPersonally, I think the lions share of these shootings are just the symptoms of a completely sick society. People feel trapped, hopeless, scared, disenfranchised...why not go out and take some people that represent why you think you feel that way? I think pharm drugs exacerbate this, or make it easier to do...look at how many of these shooters were on SSRIs. But I think, fundamentally, our society doesn't give anyone the tools they need to be happy, and everyone's kinda on their own, so we're just gonna keep seeing these things happen until we start looking at proactive solutions instead of reactive ones \\(for example: there's crime in poor neighborhood, the proactive solution would be to increase education, social support services, and make more jobs available for people...but instead we go the reactive route of hiring more police officers. Proactive approach to shootings would be, vastly increase mental health services, and foster community and open/understanding/empathetic connections between people; reactive is 'Now the teachers all have guns too'\\)...however, how sick and fucked our society is, that's never going to happen. So, just gear up for more shootings.\n\nAlso to note: I think 'all these people were directed to attack with energy weapons' is falling into the conspiracy theorists trap of not wanting the world to be random. Even though the implication is that the GOV is literally manipulating people into shooting others, at least it's not just 'random violence'. The oder of the universe is still in tact....the truth is, any of us can die any die for any random reason \\(a crazy person, a meteorite, an escaped tiger, a distracted driver\\); the universe is violent and random. It's more comforting to believe there's some sort of 'master plan', because it allows us to continue on, not terrified that we can die at any point from anything \\(which we totally can\\).",

            "body": "I would recommend finding a good teacher. My practice is centered around Qigong, but I'm sure there are yoga teachers, Tibetan meditation teachers, teachers of different branches of Western magic or Christian mysticism who can help with this. I've backed myself into enough corners to realize the extreme benefit of having someone who knows way more than I do to reach out to when needed. \n\nAgain, from a Qigong perspective, a lot of my grounding is centered around energizing the lower centers and channels, the kidney channel specifically. Additionally, I notice I have a huge block of stagnant energy in my frontal lobe most of the time. Sending that to the back of the brain can be very helpful in balancing. But again, I recommend finding a good teacher in a practice that you feel drawn to if possible.\n\nThese dark forces are absolutely what bring people depression, demotivation etc... But I think there is a lot more to it than external forces (which definitely come into play as well and are why I stopped using psychedelics). We're constantly projecting our emotions at one another, so it's easy to pick up the energies that we are susceptible to from others. Additionally, there seems to be a past life dimension to this as well, but as we grow and cultivate we can liberate generations within us. In my above message I guess I sort of lumped all this together as dark forces. \n\nI have been somewhat successful. The issue is I can clear and clear and clear all I want. But I need to remove the hooks that the dark forces cling to within myself. Like attracts like. Hooks of lust and emotion. These can be transmuted and smoothed, but it is a slow process, and, for me at least, it is not linear, but there is much slipping backwards along with moving forwards. To truly rid myself of the dark forces I not only need to remove the hooks, but also know the forces deeply, see them for what they are. This seems to be the key to permanently removing them. \n\nThere is much power and potential under the material shell of things. ",

He has had some good points about inconsistencies in major narratives (for example pointing out the agent provacatuers in the WTO protests- he was 100% right about that), but as soon as he or anyone else try to claim there's some underlying cabal of truly evil (check out his interview with Joe Rogan-he believes this group of people at the top are in contact with demons from some alternate dimension, which is at the base of basically every conspiracy he's promotes) people with inhuman goals, I'm out, whether that group be Jews, capitalists, communists, Lizard people, whatever. To date, I've seen no one challenge that, they'd much rather point out his Sandy Hook nonsense, but that way of thinking is almost identical to the way people with an anti-Semitic bent will think about Jews. I understand the security found in the \"knowledge\" that there's some evil cabal of highly ordered schemers running shit, but it just isn't a thing. It can't be, humans are far too dumb to coordinate as throughly as people would like to believe.",

Each system is assigned an IP address which is the Internet equivalent of a phone number.  The communications from your phone to the server are handled by the applications installed on the phone that leverage a set of sintructions that determine how the application and the server communicate (called protocols).  Each connection has a unique combination of IP address and source / destination ports that allows each system to prevent your communication from overlapping with my communication.  A set of hardware infrastructure called routers direct the flow of traffic, ensuring that each step along the way knows not the entire route to the end destination, but instead the very next hop.  This allows for systems to go up and down, and paths to change all dynamically.  I can assure you it's not magic, and its definitely not another dimension.  ",

I think that consciousness is a dimension unto itself, one that is neither dependent on our specific location in space nor time, and it's one that we all are connected to. I think remote viewing is simply accessing a sixth sense of sorts, that allows us to tap into this. There are more Stargate documents that basically say as much, and attempt to define remote viewing in scientific terms.\n\nAs to alien life, I definitely believe that intelligent life is out there because I've personally witnessed UFOs on two occasions. It's possible that they were just advanced earth-made technology, but I think there is also a great deal of evidence in ancient literature and religion that indicates that we were not alone, and therefore we aren't alone now.

Everything is based off of previous things. \n\n&gt;star wars\n\nA galaxy far away, in the past. That stars humans, A little green human, A big fat human, etc. Near everything still has a face, two arms, two legs, and the same general locomotion. \n\nThe Xwings are literally jet fighters, The storm troopers based off of WW2 soldiers, and the tech just guns and super swords. \n\n&gt;star trek\n\nSame stuff, literally humans, and the aliens are still INSANELY human looking. Spock is just a human with pointy ears, and all that fun stuff. \n\n&gt;independence day\n\n[still very much human characteristics](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/id4/images/8/8c/Id4_american_gallery.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141214164647). A head, two eyes, a nose bridge, what seems to be a mouth. A chest, two arms, etc. etc. \n\n&gt;hitchhikers guide to the galaxy\n\nSo, fun fact. I'm on the 5th book, and I'm not really impressed. It's a mix between /r/iamverysmart and /r/iamveryrandom. It's \"Creativeness\" Comes from not being creative, but by using common writing in uncommon ways. With descriptions that don't fit the setting, using common phrases, then turning them in their head \"For a second, nothing happened. This continued for another 2 minutes of nothing\" For example. \n\nIf anything, it's creativity is being a story in the form of a book. The kind of story a drunk uncle would say around a campfire. Including all the weird tangents. \n\nNot to mention the other books are actually very much the same as the first. He's unable to move past the same setting and characters. Failing to progress any characters more than he absolutely must. \n\n&gt;lovecraft\n\nI can't touch on him nearly as much, but you can still see connection to everyday things in his creations. A centrer form presumably holding organs, apendages that are used to do stuff with, a mobile platform for eyes, etc. It's all very much based on life we have here, because we cannot fully think outside of the box. \n\n&gt;even marvel and dc.\n\nYou're kidding right? The blue aliens are again very humanistic. The Asgardians are literally super humans. Same with the ice giants, etc. \n\n&gt;Each alien race depicted in these works is vastly different than the next.\n\nPainting a human blue/green/purple/orange doesn't magically make them different. There are a lot of very basic fundamentals that are found on almost everything around us. Such as a very clear face. Bipedal movement, Two arms for working with, hands that somehow use the human's weapons on them. etc. etc. It's all very repetitive and uncreative. And exactly what you would expect. \n\nHumans cannot create things. We can only modify things. Everything is based on everything before it. \n\nLook at a car. It's just a self-propelled cart. What's a cart if not a board with wheels for easier movement, and what's a board but a sturdy version of a deer you're dragging back to camp? Even the act of dragging is seen in nature from other animals. \n\nNothing is truely creative in any way, since it's nothing more than things we already know, zip-tied together to create things we understand. \n\nNot to mention how nearly every alien race is impossible, but glossed over due to the fact that if we knew how that life could have been made, we would make it. Much like actual Sci-Fi tech. \n\nFor example, Take \"The Orville\". A half serious, half comedic show about Sci-Fi. There's a race, forget the name, but they're [theese things](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z91ZYvD6Hdg954ZoHOCdOxpPk4M=/0x0:780x439/920x613/filters:focal(254x71:378x195):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56814517/orville_baby.0.jpg). Again, very basically humans. Face, arms, etc. \n\nNow, lore wise. They're a mono-gender civilization, and on birth have a gender change surgery. \n\nNow this raises the questions. Such as how did that work pre-surgery skills? Why would it had been done in the first place? *How the fuck is there a baby*? None of these will be answered, because it's just shit used to say \"These are aliens\". \n\nOther examples, Dwarves in LOTR. Living underground is needlessly hard. No real point. And how did they live before discovering mining? Same book, Hobbits, they're a very lazy and seemingly weak people. Other empires would have conquered them. \n\nMass Effect, Krogans are extra organs for their harsh environment. With secondary, and even tertiary systems. In the case of testicals, 4. Yet still very human like. A face, two arms, two legs, etc. The Elcor are basically just Elephants without trunks, and the Hanar are just space jellyfish. \n\nEvery peice of \"Alien\" description is based off of other earth-bound creatures or legends. \n\n&gt;Look i know you have never experienced this and its probably hard for you to relate, but this artistic connection with something other than our world does happen.\n\nExcept that's just it. You cannot imagine, not describe something in which is not of this world. Try to imagine a new colour, a new shape, or a new creature. \n\nYou can't do colours because your brain is limited in what it can process visually. You can't do shapes because every shape ever already exists. And you cannot do creatures, because either they'd be impossible to actually survive due to the human mind not being able to actually create the environment in which the creature would need to be shaped by, or because you would base it off of earth based creatures, of which require a earth like planet to have been raised up in.\n\n&gt;Go read some Lovecraft and then tell me how that dude had a limited creative mind and wasnt tapped into some dark dimension\n\nI don't need to read it to know that he didn't have anything special. Because he was a human, with a human mind. ",

This would fit into a sort of \"timeline interference pattern\" theory which means that every \"other\" timeline diverges dramatically from his own simply due to his significantly large interference with the past, creating an effect akin to light interference fringe patterns but from the 5th+ dimension perspective.  iow, every other timeline, he travels to a \"non-titor\" timeline and warns the timeline, thus actually nullifying his own time-traveling experience in that particular timeline having created a \"titor timeline\", but the next timeline over he would be in a \"non-titor\" timeline again.  This is similar to the idea of \"traveling back in time to stop yourself from traveling back in time\" - it would create a timeline interference pattern from 5+ dimensional perspective.\n\nOverall, larp or not, I noticed what you noticed that it'd be off by maybe ten years.\n\nThen again, you got plenty of people such as Bill Cooper and even secret-society/illuminati folk predicting this shit back in the 60s, meaning Titor could just be a well-informed larp.",

Similiar to the Higgs Field.\n\nThe Higgs field might have further intricities with Holofractual theory. It is responsible for giving mass to the Weak force, thus breaking Electroweak symetry. In simple terms in extremely hot temperatures(think at the start of the universe) the weak bosons are identicle to the Photon. A possible theory suggests all the forces, including possibly gravity, were indistinguishable at the very start.\n\nMaybe this would point to a single dimension which than fractured into the respectic parts as temperature cooled.\n\nI went on a bit of a tangent, but I really dislike the term Black Hole as really few aspects of Holofractual allign with an actual Black Hole.",

I feel like this doesn't mean that it is specifically bad, just powerful.\n\nIt sounded like multiple voices telling me \"it's ok\" \"don't be scared\" \"do more\". The fear started to become more intense and I noticed the trip getting more scary/sinister, so I took a deep breath(I don't know if I actually did it or if I just mentally did it....because..... dmt) but after the mental breath the beings became more friendly(at least that's the way it felt)  and the background went from dark and grey scale to bright colors. The beings started to laugh and becon me more but I felt the trip wearing off. And they would just repeat \"it's ok\" \"don't be scared\" \"do more\", and I still felt that they were powerful beings but the fear went away.\n\nNow the gear could have went away for one 4 reasons \n\n1) I realized they did not mean any harm and the beings are good and want to help, I was just startled by their power\n\n2)they are evil and I felt it, but they were able to manipulate and deceive me so that I do more dmt and get into their influence (archon shit)\n\n3)after I took the breath I realized I was in more  control than I thought I had so I just felt more at ease knowing I wasn't completely free falling through the Nth dimension\n\n4) all of it is a figment of my imagination. I imagine the aliens and beings because they're going to keep talking about it and some beans and I just manifested them. The intense feelings I felt were......me doing dmt\n\nThis is very hard for me because I really do believe in some sort of spiritual connection as much as I believe in life somewhere else in the universe (like I really think there is, but if there was definitive facts stating otherwise [nearly impossible to prove a negative] I would accept them). I have learned many life lessons and had extreme foresight from doing psychedelics. It 100% is stranger than reality. That being said, all the lessons I've learned seemed to be things I already knew but just didn't grasp the full blown concept. And the foresight seemed to be more of a Sherlock esque foresight rather than an actual vision.\n\nSo.... Still not quite sure, need more tests, I'll get back to you guys after Easter",

            "body": "Oh, I completely agree. Before we developed the ability to measure or detect UV, you could say the same thing about UV. I didn't suggest the beings instilled themselves in our drug trips; I'm suggesting the beings are always there, and we lack the ability to interact. We can't substantiate what we can't measure; that is not proof that it does not exist.\n\nI did have an experience that may be of similar logic. Entada Rheedii is an African bean that shamans take to speak with the dead. It is supposed to facilitate lucid dreamings. \n\nI took it for a few days, and I started having crazy and vivid dreams; I think it is possible that I always have dreams like this, but I don't normally remember it. After about a week of taking it, I had a dream of my deceased step father, whom I don't remember dreaming of since he passed a decade ago. Again, I think it's possible I may have dreamt of him and simply not remembered. I found that I was waking up and the dreams still seemed very vivid even after I woke, instead of fading instantly into forgetfulness. I find it more likely that the dreams are always there, and always vivid; only the bean grants the ability to remember a little longer.\n\nIn the past, I didn't believe in anything that couldn't be measured; or at the very least, I had no interest in discussing it or debating it.\n\nThen one day, I was sitting on my bed, awake; suddenly, a humanoid being made of a void filled with stars materialized in the doorway. It emanated visceral fear; it radiated fear like a homeless person radiates the stench of their own filth. This being entered the room with purpose and intent, as if it had done so many times before and it knew exactly what it was doing: it came directly to me, and before I knew what was happening, it was upon me, pushing me down, pushing it's face into my face; then it kissed me, and it's lips sealed to my lips. As I breathed out, it breathed in; it sucked the air from my lungs; as I breathed in, it exhaled, and the cold frostiness of space entered into me. At that moment, I somehow accessed the knowledge of my ancient forefathers, and I understood what it was. I drew on strength I didn't know I had; it was feeding on the fear it had created; instead, I fed it confidence and strength; I laughed. It recoiled, and cocked it's head as if examining me; then in an instant, it was gone.\n\nI was stunned. I was on no drugs, no alcohol, no medication, nor had I taken any mind altering substances in recent weeks; I had never had any similar experience. There was a strange quality to this experience; I felt that I had been thrust into a dimension of hyper reality; this moment was more real to me, than any other experience I have had before or since, in my 45 years of experience on this planet. I had no idea what to do. I tried to go about my normal life and routine.\n\nA few days later, I came home and as I came into the entrance of the building, the landlords daughter was playing there with a doll, as small children do. She looked up at me and said: \"Did you know that a girl died in your bed?\" She was very small, so small I had trouble understanding her child talk; I wasn't sure I had understood. Later, I asked the landlord about it, and he pulled me into his office and closed the door. He explained in a low voice that the previous tenant had been addicted to heroin or hard drugs, and that she had died in my room, in my bed, of an overdose.\n\nAs he explained, I came to understand: the being I had seen emanated fear, so that it could feed on these negative emotions. It had found the girl in a moment of weakness and preyed upon her; she find herself in a downward spiral, without knowing or understanding why, and she died in fear and terror. This being had made a habit of feeding on this girl; when it entered my room, it thought I was her, and so it tried to feed on me.\n\nIf you ask a scientist what I experienced, he might say: you experienced a moment of sleep paralysis. This is what happens sometimes in the moment between sleeping and waking; the brain doesn't have full control over the body, and this can create a sensation of weight on the chest, and the brain creates an illusion of being held down by a witch or a demon to explain what you are experiencing. There is nothing supernatural here; this can happen even when you are awake. \n\nI'm not a superstitious person. I don't believe in ghosts or spirits. Most likely, this experience I had really was just sleep paralysis.\n\nbut I was wide awake. I never woke up. Although I have never had an experience like this since, sometimes I have a feeling that something is near me in the dark, and I have trouble falling asleep, and in those moments I remember that incident. It happened a quarter of a century ago, and I still remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday. \n\nI am split on this issue, I have two minds: Mostly I don't believe in ghosts. When I hear other people telling similar stories, I tell myself: this sounds unbelievable and fantastic. This person either wants attention, or they are making up stories, or they have some mental illness like schizophrenia. I tell myself these things, because they're scientific and reasonable, and it's easier to sleep at night.\n\nbut sometimes I think of that night. I don't tell this story often, because the other part of my mind thinks it was real. It was real, and telling the story sometimes unlocks a door in other people's mind; the door is like a filter. As long as the door is closed, those who feed on fear can't find us so easily, but when our minds are open we must be strong and not be afraid. If we're afraid when we're falling asleep, that's when they find you",

The idea that the argument is supposed to be believed, and that the person writing it truly thinks that the claims are well\\-founded and well\\-reasoned in that article is hilarious. Like arguing for the existence of Santa Claus. At the same time, I don't know that any of these claims are false, I have literally zero evidence that shows that Santa Claus can't exist. The claims are just so poorly founded, and the few arguments presented are so terrible at showing that their claim is true that it's funny.\n\nSince spacetime can be manipulated as they wish, perceived time goes to zero. The entity viewing the children can warp the time dimension such that a year to it is a millisecond to you. \n\n\\(in case you don't know, relativity says that high velocity shrinks spatial dimensions and shrinks time in such a way that the fast\\-moving object perceives time around it as going slower\\)\n\nMaking sense of what the children are doing should be no obstacle. Surely they can just film them over the course of the year, and spend the last millisecond reviewing and judging the footage. They probably know the order in which each child was visited, and can sort the frames to show \"movies\" of each child separately.\n\nIs this sufficient for you to believe in Santa Claus?

If you only look thru red... Or only look through blue... U see things 2-dimensionally. But looking through both colors at once, you see in a third dimension.\n\nWith CNN for instance, you're dealing with the influence of the State Department (for instance CNNs chief Syria correspondent is married to the former State Department spokesman James Rubin), CIA (project mockingbird), Isreal lobby and it's corporate parent Time Warner. Time itself was created by a Skull and Bones member. \n\nSo you have clear biases and agendas there (and everywhere) and clear biases and agendas in the funding and ownership of RT.\n\nIf you're still stuck on individual sources, and not thinking for yourself with all the information you can gather from all sources, you're not getting the full, 3-dimensional image.\n\nClear enough for you?\n\n",

So every possible variation of the fish is tried, but only the one that randomly *grows a lightbulb in its forehead* survives? A gut worm's life cycle is thus: a worm crawls out of your anus and lays eggs, hoping you scratch it, get the eggs in your fingernails and eventually touch food, and *eat the egg.* So it just figured that out somehow? A bug comes out of nowhere in the forest, evolution tries a bunch of things, and only when it randomly started *looking exactly like a leaf* did it start surviving? A fruit tree only reproduces when an animal eats the fruit, shits the seeds out in natural fertilizer. How did it know that? Some trees seeds only crack open when a forest fire burns the hard husk. How did that come to be randomly? And so on.\n\nTalk about cartoons coming into existence out of nowhere, you just described the theory of evolution. Either way, everything came from somewhere, and it makes more sense, when something consciously, deliberately, and ingeniusly created all of this.",

You highlighted how it was isolation, abuse and neglect from childhood that reinforced that behaviour and wiring of your brain, so obviously that wiring that bypasses your empathetic emotional response is strong and won't be broken so easily. But you also highlighted that on mdma you were capable of feeling that connection, which is a good thing! If you weren't capable of that feeling in the first place then you would never have felt it when on mdma. The drug simply enhanced that feeling.  \nSo I'd reckon that those same practices would still help, but it'll just take more work, since you'll be trying to rewire connections that have been long established. If you want to feel empathy again and experience those higher-connective states of being then you'll have to practice empathising, even if it doesn't feel genuine at first. Fake it till you make it, they say. You can't learn to run if you don't know how to walk. Alternatively, you could simply not try, and you could continue living with a sociopathic brain (note: that's not a bad thing. It's just a thing.), but in doing so, despite being clear of empathy so that you may see things logically, you will lack the ability to intuitively understand another persons emotional state in full, without the need to ask.  \nLogic is a direct product of 2 dimensional state of being. It's ingrained into this reality, as our dimension is built from that - sets of alternate logic paths - but it is lower dimensional. Emotion is an artifact of higher dimensional (4d)/astral states of being - of inherent connection between all things in the 3d. If you shut yourself off from that source you won't be able to use what it can provide for you. But that's your choice. ",

Dying at 80 90 years old after retiring at 60? That doesn't sound right to me so 10 sounds nice.\n\nI made a choice and I am now in love. Do I keep trusting love and trust it will take me where I need to go and be safe in a cocoon unaway from the \"guilty\" and preserve my life force? Funny I was typing this to ask you but by typing I have asked for myself.\n\nOne last question is who do I know who to bring with me? Not feeling as safe in Washington and Montana will be straight flames and heat here soon, I can feel it coming in fast.\n\nWhen do I make the move?\n\nWhen do I drop all notions of \"success\" and \"make a run for the hills\" so to speak? Because I feel it growing and there's a lot of fear and negativity around my body (this apartment complex. Always hear screams that question my sanity)\n\nIt's dark and heavy and it affects me when I walk out the door in the morning. Tears me apart.\n\nSo now that I've seen both dark and light and obviously choose love, how do I get to my destination to keep my body in safety and prevent accidents to my \"person\" if you're aware of what I mean because I think we have a interesting journey ahead of us that will take us all over the place\n\nBut maybe I can finally let go and just live and be in the moment. May I do that in safety while incarnated in third dimension please if I really do need to go another 10 years? I want to be surrounded by plenty of white light.\n\nFunnels are great but so is the feeling of love and knowing I'm safe and I can go where I need to without harm to my person or having to carry a stupid gun with \"ammo\" how pointless and it kept me locked in fear.\n\nI release fear so I appreciate help\n\nAny responses are thoroughly read for enjoyment rather than work for once.\n\nSymbols are powerful\n\nThank you\n\nI'm home, almost ",

They just have to travel through a thin dimensional barrier to visit our planet or plane of existence.

Ergo, its words don't mean shit and can be changed according to one's desires. There is a whole other dimension to one's thought processes when beliefs like these are embedded in one's psyche. \n\nMuslims weren't going around bombing anything until the US interfered. In fact, in terms of modernisation combined with Islamic beliefs, Iran and Afghanistan were doing quite alright until the US decided to stick their nose into everything. \n\nI find it odd that a Chinese guy knows so little about US involvement in the Middle East. This whole terrorism thing started because of their involvement. This whole brand of extremist Islam is Wahhabism; it didn't exit before the eighteenth century, and didn't spread so much until recently, as Wahhabist groups gained power through US support. \n\nEither way force feeding Muslims pork and forcing them into becoming atheists is abhorrent; its far from civilized. That's the type of shit ISIS does. If you support that, fine, but I hope you don't end up in that sort of situation, ever. \n\n",

            "body": "So can a truck on the freeway. It doesn't mean it's a sufficiently good response.\n\nHowever, I do agree that pills can help for a time. I've mostly dealt with pain medications, but I've been prescribed SSRIs too. \n\nI see two immediate dangers in long\\-term medication, both of which have taken me for quite a ride in my own struggles.\n\n1\\) Illusion: True experience comes from present attention. Drugs can facilitate or inhibit the immediateness of your experience. Valium and most opiates make the world \\(and your pain\\) feel more distant. That's primarily how they appear to work. LSD, psilocybin, and many strains of cannabis put your awareness squarely at the present. One dimension creates illusion, the other untangles, to varying degrees and in different ways. Almost all of the meds I've ever been prescribed have been of the kind that put distance between me and my experience. When you're in that state, you're oblivious to it. You're not sufficiently conscious, and also too comfortable to notice. Once you get off them, for one reason or another, reality rushes back in, and in that state, if you're vulnerable and resentful too, there's no knowing what you'd feel compelled to do.\n\n2\\) Addiction: Well, anything I can say about that has been said before. We get addicted to lots of things, but our relationship to the thing that compels us is always subjective and more complicated than we would assume. My inability to deal with my pain in a healthy and responsible way caused me to ignore pretty serious side\\-effects of the medication for several years. At one time, I even neglected to see the doctor after a loud crack in my spine because the pain subsided into my medication within the weekend, so I thought it couldn't have been that bad. Months later I learned that a bracket that holds my spine together broke in two places while tying my shoelaces that fateful night. Meds made me choose to ignore important signals from my body because I believed their illusion that \"everything is fine\" because I was addicted to the effects of the morphine.\n\nIt's a dreadful circle, and again, one doesn't have to fall into it, but all too many do. Throw in a terrible childhood, a nihilistic attitude, and broken heart, and you got yourself a time\\-bomb.\n\nThe problem is that that is not an unusual combination these days. Whether all this is deliberately fostered or orchestrated is a debate I'm not into, but it's a reality which is being politically milked.",

            "body": "Pulled from a breakdown of the document here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/8kqwj9/tic_tac_ufo_document_dissected_analysis_of_the/\n\n\"I am writing this as it's own post, due to the size of the post, and I feel it goes into much greater detail than some of the comments I am seeing in other threads. It is a subsection to my (now even much) larger research into the AATIP program and TTSA releases, which can be seen in full, here: http://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/to-the-stars-academy-of-arts-science-tom-delonge-and-the-secret-dod-ufo-research-program/\n\n=-=--=-=-=-==--=\n\nGeorge Knapp Story About \u201cTic Tac UFO Analysis\u201d Document\n\nOn May 18, 2018, investigative journalist George Knapp of CBS Channel 8, Las Vegas, broke a story about a document said to detail the Tic Tac UFO sighting and analyzed the importance of the encounter.\n\nAccording to Mr. Knapp\u2019s story, it states:\n\n&gt; Since the Pentagon\u2019s release of three UFO videos, armchair experts have speculated that maybe the objects are birds or balloons or something mundane.\n&gt; \n&gt; But now, the I-Team has obtained an in-depth report prepared by and for the military, and it analyzes the so-called Tic Tac UFO using the most sophisticated sensor systems &gt; in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Over a two-week period in late 2004, an unknown, 45-foot long Tic Tac shaped object played cat and mouse with the U.S. Navy off the coast of California. The mighty U.S.S. &gt; Nimitz aircraft carrier, and its support ships including the U.S.S. Princeton, carrying the most sophisticated sensor systems in the world, repeatedly detected recurring glimpses of the Tic Tac but were unable to lock on.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2026 SNIP \u2026\n&gt; \n&gt; But in the months since the release, the Pentagon has clammed up. It has declined to release official documents about the Nimitz Tic Tac encounter, or similar incidents.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2026 SNIP \u2026\n&gt; \n&gt; Pilots reported a large disturbance just under the surface of the ocean, round and 100 yards across. It appeared as if the Tic Tac was rendezvousing with the underwater object.\n&gt; \n&gt; Among the key findings in the report \u2014 the AAV is not something that belongs to the U.S. or any other nation. It was so advanced, it rendered U.S. capabilities ineffective. It showed velocities far greater than anything known to exist, and it could turn itself invisible, both to radar and the human eye. Essentially, it was undetectable, and unchallenged.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u2026 SNIP \u2026\n&gt; \n&gt; The report including statements from seven F-18 pilots as well as radar operators on the ships. Despite the seriousness of the encounter, the pilots faced ridicule after their encounters. The Navy\u2019s initial report was buried, not forwarded to command. It was decided the AAV was not a threat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Five years later, a more comprehensive assessment was compiled but was never made public and has been seen by few, even inside the Pentagon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Former intelligence official Chris Mellon opined in the Washington Post that the Pentagon\u2019s unwillingness to discuss these encounters or share information with other military branches is a threat to national security, comparable to when the CIA and FBI failed to share information prior to 9/11\n&gt; \n&gt; The analysis report is not dated and has no logo, but four separate people who are familiar with its contents confirmed to the I-Team it is the real deal and was written as part of a Pentagon program.\n\nI have used only portions of the article that I feel are relevant here. I invite you all to click on the link above to see the entire breakdown of Mr. Knapp\u2019s story.\n\nThe document that was obtained, and released by Mr. Knapp / I-Team, is here (I converted it to a more accessible pdf dimension, along with making it searchable): http://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tictac.pdf\n\nI would like to point out, before I critique this story, that Mr. George Knapp is a personal friend of mine, and someone I respect highly. My analysis on this document is based on my opinion, and I in no way want to insinuate Mr. Knapp has falsified the document or is misleading the public with this story. Rather, I offer my critique in hopes to bring some insight into understanding what this may, or may not, ultimately be. Mr. Knapp should be commended for his long standing reputation in reporting about the UFO phenomenon, and my critique here is solely based on my opinion about this particular document.\n\nNow, that being said, there are some issues with the above story that need to be pointed out. First and foremost, the document itself does not, in any way, resemble a report prepared by the Pentagon or any branch of the U.S. Military. Although there are many types of report and briefing formats, and they vary from agency to agency, there are still common characteristics that you will find in documents such as this.\n\nThe most obvious, to me, is a lack of any classification stamp or header/footer. It is noted in Mr. Knapp\u2019s story the document was \u201cunclassified\u201d \u2014 however, most \u201cunclassified\u201d documents still contain the identifying marks to stipulate the classification level of the document. ([EXAMPLE](http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/intellipedia/intellipedia-brokenarrow-bentspear-dullsword.pdf) #1 | [EXAMPLE](http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/aviation/AFD-080408-039.pdf) #2) Of course, there are exceptions and mistakes, but this is a sign it was probably not prepared by the Pentagon, or it would contain such a classification level stamp or mark.\n\nSecond, there are no headers, contracts numbers or any cover page. Most, if not all, reports of this nature contain a cover page identifying what the information in the report is, what it refers to, what contract it pertains to, etc. ([EXAMPLE](http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/psyops/popas.pdf) #1 | [EXAMPLE](http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/odni/ICA_2017_01.pdf) #2). In these examples cited here, from different time frames and agencies, they both have cover pages and reference pages about what the reports are about. This is another indication this document in question, is not official.\n\nThird, the names are blacked out with the exception of Commander David Fravor. At first, I noted this as being suspicious, but later got clarification that Mr. Knapp was the one who did the redaction, based on a tweeted comment he posted on Twitter. Although that explains the discrepancy, it does bring up another fact, and that is, nothing about the document\u2019s release is close to being \u201cofficial\u201d or \u201cby the book.\u201d Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), when documents such as these are released, ALL names are redacted/blacked out. This is due to FOIA exemption (b)(6) which stipulates that for privacy reasons, names (and other personally identifiable information) are redacted to ensure their identities remain private. Whomever gave this document to Mr. Knapp, obviously did not care to conceal identities of those mentioned, and I think Mr. Knapp deserves credit for taking the step to ensure these names remain outside the public domain (except Commander Fravor who has gone public). I will note, Mr. Knapp never claimed this was obtained under a FOIA release. However, I note this FOIA exemption because this is a standard rule/practice when agencies release documents, they will follow the same policies and procedures when they proactively release information to the public, but not under the FOIA. These facts support the document was a \u201cleak\u201d rather than a \u201crelease.\u201d\n\nBut the same red flags that I have noted above about the exact provenance of the videos released by TTSA, are displayed here. Was this document really written/prepared BY the Pentagon as this news article states? If so, then the circumvention of the review process to get a document in the public domain was skipped, and we are seeing a record that may not be officially in the public domain (yet). In today\u2019s world we live in, it\u2019s news cycle after news cycle of \u201cleak\u201d after \u201cleak\u201d \u2014 drip after drip. The question on whether or not this is a healthy news environment I will leave for a different discussion, but this does make us question who gave it to Mr. Knapp, and if it was prepared by the Pentagon, will there be repercussion for this type of record to be \u201cleaked\u201d to a journalist (regardless of it being \u201cunclassified\u201d)?\n\nFurther to this point, I feel with the red flags above, along with the fact that we may not see any repercussions as time goes on, there is a large possibility this was not prepared BY the Pentagon, but rather, was sent TO the Pentagon. We can probably assume by a contractor, like BAAS, which is connected to the AATIP program. This is supported by the style of the report itself, and the footnotes used on the bottom of the record. It\u2019s fairly rare to see non-government sources, especially Wikipedia, which is used quite often as a source. But what is rather even more strange, is AATIP, \u201cAdvanced Aviation Threat Identification Program\u201d (or even the \u201cAdvanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\u201d), or the Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program (see below) etc. are not named in the report, AT ALL. The report lacks any \u201cobjective\u201d to why it was written (ie: it does not stipulate any information as I noted above) or stipulates on whether it was a \u201cquarterly report\u201d or a \u201cweekly report\u201d or a \u201csignificant case study\u201d or anything. It just seems like it was cobbled together, which also, is highly suspicious that it is anything of an \u201cofficial\u201d nature.\"\n\n- /u/blackvault\n\ncont...\n\n",

            "body": "Very likely both. The Universe is likely teeming with life on different levels of development. The problem is that most people only see the possibility of material development and do not see the possibility and great importance of spiritual development. When that is taken into account the highest developed beings in the Cosmos would be deeply in touch with their divinity and experietally comprehend the intertwinement and unity of all things. Thus they would act from love and not hateful ignorance. However it is also likely we would find negatively oriented beings, especially those acting out of ignorance of the underlying interconnectedness of all things, which experimentally is felt as love.\n\nI do think it's highly likely extraterrestrials are here and have been for a long time. If they know about Earth it is statistically more likely they have known about if for a while, rather than finding us just now, when we have come to this point in our development. Thus it is understandable why UFOs and extraterrestrials may appear in ancient art, myths and legends. \n\nMany of these might also be beings that are interdimensional, but this is a difficult distinction to make really. Mainly because if you posit a multidimensional reality then you can see that all beings are by definition multidimensional. The only difference is awareness of said dimensions, as well as obtaining the proper scientific instruments to objectively measure and explore said dimensions. Most otherdimensional exploration is usually done through experience born from intense meditative practices, which is a more subjective method - but then again you have to ask yourself how objective these dimensions even are, especially when it is so often posited that the astral dimension (where beings supposedly go after the death of their physical bodies) is entirely based and manipulatable through thoughts - it basically consists of thought forms, making it subjective in many ways by default. The causal and upper planes/dimensions are usually deemed more stable and objective in esoteric teachings, but even in the astral realms objective consensus thought environments must exist (the consensus creation of the minds of multiple beings - Earth in a way is such a creation, but it is physical).\n\nEither way, interesting question. Ultimately I can't say I know for sure either way, but I would say it's highly likely that there are both positive and negatively oriented extraterrestrials - and I'd even say this differs within each group/species of extraterrestrials. After all not all humans are evil and neither are all of them good (if we look at it on the physcial level of species and not from a deeper level of being). The Universe is not black or white, it's usually both and everything in between as well.",

You are making way more assumptions if you are arguing that we're living in a simulation, because you're assuming there's another reality outside ours without any sort of verifiable observation. You're really just adding another layer of reality on top of ours and assuming... well, literally everything about it.\n\nAny reality on top of ours is irrelevant to the topic.  we are talking about this universe and what happens here.  There is A LOT that supports the simulation theory.  The probability of us being in a sim is so great that its even more probable that any layer above us is *also* in a sim...the theory is that serious.  like I said its a legit theory with a lot of merrit behind it.  \n\n\n&gt;You can't use someone's anecdote that \"Australia moved\" as evidence of a simulation/parallel dimension or whatever without making huge, world altering assumptions.\n\nTheres no way to prove it one way or the other, but what I can do is at least explain how it would happen.  If i can explain that then that makes the claim just as valid as yours of it never changing\n\n&gt;you can, however, use the known and quantifiable fact that people's memories aren't perfect to explain why someone think a country is in the wrong spot. \n\nthat doesn't apply here because that doesn't explain how multitudes of people remember the same detail incorrectly in the same way.  That goes beyond just bad memory.  Its too coincidental that so many people from so many backgrounds remember things wrong exactly the same.  \n\n&gt;Not many assumptions are being made, because we know memories are a shit show sometimes.\n\nSo how do explain the above?  How do so many people come up with an entire movie (kazaam starring sinbad) on their own (and no, this is not a case of people hearing someone else say it first.  people tend to discover the mandela effect after looking for more info on a subject and have their minds blown when realizing it never existed but others remember it)\n\n",

            "body": "Einstein was chosen to be the face of the Relativity theory because any idea that is to be forced onto a group of people needs a trustworthy, charismatic authority that they can defer to.\n\nThe relativity meme was simply a release valve to frantically cover up the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which showed the earth to be motionless.\n\nAs Nevile Martin Gwyne writes:\n\n&gt; Einstein's works can be searched from beginning to end without revealing a single original thought of real importance [...]\n\n&gt;Curved space, for instance, was thought of by Riemann; adding a fourth dimension, that of time, to geometry to create the new concept of space-time, by Minkowski; the doctrine that objects contract in proportion to the speed at which they moved, by Fitzgerald; and the idea that the velocity of light in a vacuum was constant irrespective of the notion of any object connected with the light ray, by Lorentz.\n\n&gt;Did he first assert the impossibility of detecting the velocity of the earth through the ether? No, this was done by J.H. Poincar\u00e9 and H.A. Lorentz.\n\n&gt;Did Einstein coin the name Relativity? No, Poincar\u00e9 did [...] It was Poincar\u00e9 too, who first asserted that no velocity can exceed that of light.  Einstein was not the first to assert that a clock in motion runs slow. This was done by Sir Joseph Larmor. Einstein was not the first to assert that matter is crinkles in curved space. Professor W.K. Clifford advanced this quaint notion in 1870, nine years before Einstein\u2019s birth.\n\n&gt;Did Einstein even invent the famous equation, E = mc2, which has become almost synonymous with his name the equation from which nuclear energy and nuclear destruction capability are supposedly derived? Not even that. In 1881 J.J. Thompson had produced a formula, E = 3/4 mc2, in respect of a charged spherical conductor moving in a straight line. In 1900 Poincar\u00e9 suggested that electromagnetic energy might possess mass density in relation to energy density, such that E = mc2, where E is energy and m is mass.\n\n&gt;[I]f Einstein had not existed another would have been selected to fill his place, for he possessed no qualities which are not available in profusion in almost any place in any age... The obstinate truth about Einstein is that in mathematics he was no more than competent and that among the so-called discoveries presented to the world under his name one can search in vain for one that was original. Had Einstein not been selected, for reasons which had nothing to do with intellectual ability, to act out a role which was deemed necessary for the furtherance of the war against God and civilisation, his claim to immortal fame would have been that of a talented and not-undistinguished physicist, a life-long **Zionist**, an occasionally enthusiastic admirer of Stalin\u2019s Russia",

Black Holes are part of the old 'Old Earth Creationism' model that adopted Big Bang Creationism and became wildly popular in the pseudo-scientific sci-fi loving creationist community which dominated the US in the mid and late 20th century.\n\nBlack Holes are easily dismissed and all Black Hole related phenomenon can be attributed to Plasma and Plasma Crystal behavior by fractal scaling of phenomenon observed in plasma laboratories. Black Holes are nothing more than science fiction designed to sell books and warp the public into fake science.\n\nAgain, if you wanted to test the Theory that China exists, you have the means to test that theory. You can imagine a test for that theory and conduct it. Can you imagine an experiment or test to determine if a \"4th spatial dimension exists?\"  What 3 dimensional object or configuration of object or circuits can you draft? If you had the world's greatest telescope or instrument can you measure the 'mass', 'width', 'height', 'length', 'volume', or 'area' of any of this nonsense?\n\nThe imagined authority of your SERN operatives have no authority when they start talking whimsical non-sense.\n",

            "body": "So where were we?\nTo recap:\n- Saturn was known as Kronos God of TIME\n- Saturn = Satan\n- Saturn\u2019s symbolized by the black cube\n- Black cube = time cube = tesseract\n- Saturn may be an AI quantum supercomputer?\n- The new DWave quantum computers look like massive black cubes\n\nOkay so the new DWave quantum computers are special because they use \u201cq bits\u201d or \u201cquantum bits\u201d instead of regular binary bits in order to compute faster. Binary bits are 1s and 0s but a q bit can be a 1, a 0, or both at the same time. The creators of these machines have said themselves that these computers literally reach into parallel universes to pull out information to solve problems faster. Like billions of times faster than regular computers. The tiny area where two parallel universes overlap are where the q bits exist. These machines have also been described by the creators as being like an \u201calter to an alien god\u201d. Hm. Look up the Ted Talks about these things.\n\nThere\u2019s like two or three of these computers in existence and they are used by none other than NASA and CERN. Now CERN is where the World Wide Web was invented. WWW in Hebrew is Vah Vah Vah or 666. We plug into the World Wide Web with our ethernet cables. I believe the internet is another dimension - or, the ether.\n\nThe internet is like a place between places where you can talk with people all over the world almost instantly. We can peer into this world from the windows of our phone and computers screens. I believe someday these windows will be \u201cbroken\u201d with new virtual reality technologies and a WiFi system that covers the Earth. Perhaps this, along with new RFID chip technology, relates to HAARP and the Hive Mind that the powers at be wish to make of us. This is predicted in the Bible as well - the book of Revelation says that everyone who has the mark will think with one mind. The Freemasons also love the symbol of the bee hive. Also funny how hives use the hexagram.\n\nI like to compare phones and computers and even televisions to black mirrors. Black mirrors were magical objects back in the day mystics would use to look into the spirit world and even see the future.. kind of like the show Black Mirror. Perhaps all of our electronics are portals into the ether. This is why in movies we see ghosts and paranormal beings affect them and even travel through them - we see this in programs like Stranger Things, Poltergeist, The Ring etc. We also know that electronics are the biggest tool for brainwash and can even induce hypnotic trances. Maybe a form of possession? Think pornography, violence, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.\n\nIf Artificial Intelligence, \u201cthe demon\u201d, is already running the world I would imagine it lives inside the internet, which I think may some day be able to connect to all electronics. Which is kind of already does.\n\nThe Bible also tells us that the AntiChrist will think to change the times and laws. Now Satan, Saturn, AI, what have you - has already done this. We use the Gregorian calendar, which is not the original calendar humanity used to use (one that uses the names of false gods for each month - also featuring satanic holidays such as Christmas, Easter, etc.) and we no longer use the laws of God but rather confusing and redundant man made laws.\n\nBut what if this verse goes deeper? What if it is also saying the beast wants to change the TIMELINE and the LAWS of physics? This is where CERN comes in. We all know all the crazy satanic symbolism surrounding CERN. At least I hope so - if not so some research on it. One thing I will say is that there is a statue of Shiva the Destroyer God right in front of the complex. Now, why would a place that has been criticized by such notable scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Neil de Grasse Tyson as having the potential to destroy the universe - put a statue like of a goddess doing the dance of destruction right outside?\n\nThe CERN facility is placed in Switzerland, a place known for its SWISS WATCHES and SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS. Time is money, money is time. It\u2019s also placed right on top of what is thought to be the ruins of the temple of Apollo. A place, in the ancient past, thought to be an entrance to hell. Now look at this verse in Revelation. Ironically, Revelation 9:11:\n\n\u201cTheir king is the angel from the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon - the Destroyer.\u201d\n\nNow this relates to 9/11 because if you look at the memorial they built for the twin towers, the reflecting pools, they\u2019re massive black squares within black squares, also pits.\n\nBut this verse literally tells us Apollo is the king of the bottomless pit. CERN is also known for trying to create mini black holes. If they were to succeed in doing this do you think a black hole could be considered a bottomless pit? Do you think it could create a portal to hell? And what\u2019s at the bottom of a black hole? A singularity. Think AI. More later.",

And probably NOTHING at all like life here too. \n\nI will agree that stories of extra terrestrial intelligence visiting earth in interstellar craft are probably fake though. I would say that all instances of UFO sightings that involve actual aircraft can be explained in mundane ways, like secret government tech. Claims of alien sightings are useful to discredit these sightings that might expose government secrets, and association with ideas about aliens are also used to discredit \"conspiracy theories\" in general. For example, I've seen trolls claim that aliens destroyed the Twin Towers in NYC using directed energy weapons. They do things like that to undermine more mundane explanations, like accusations that the US government was involved and that all three towers going down were actually controlled demolitions. Consider also the wild ideas of shape-shifting reptilians from another dimension, these accusations of intelligent aliens undermine credibility in other \"conspiracy theories\" by mere association. If I say \"I'm a conspiracy theorist\", someone might assume I believe the ruling class is actually reptile aliens. And bad actors push extreme conspiracy theories like that on purpose to make us look crazy for thinking that the psychopaths running corporations and government do harmful things behind closed doors.

I knew it was there but couldn't talk to it, couldn't really see it but I could feel it there. ",

Maybe some 30,000 (or less) have experienced it. \n\nIt creates a synthetic and perpetual  neural tsunami in your mind.  In short you are synthetically dead after just one use. \n\nDuring the time you experience the chemical your concept of time is no longer based on our planetary laws of 1=1s. In fact (at first) you feel every dead cell group your body harbors call to you to remind you that your living cells are joining them. \nIf you have a past injury you feel that injured area pulsate first. \n\nAfter every cell, stem and neuron escapes your senses you die- \n\nThis signifies the dark hazing state of consciousness fading. (As you mentally see a fog / cloud consuming you (up until) the last breaths of life lingering in your body release into the world.\n\n (as the last bluish specs of reality fade away from you, and what ever forces of light (beyond our understanding of the universe) come for you... A pulsating ancient hieroglyph emerges from the darkness... \n\nYour soul awakens attached to this additional dimension of time and space. You are on earth, (it just no longer is the same concept of reality which you once knew before)-\n\nYou are on earth, but atlantis is where you are. \n\nYou can't interact with anything or you will be ejected. You must remain calm and controlled. It becomes very apparent that you are a guest in what I'd assume christians refer to as purgatory. \n\nYou are no longer you... You become something more- Something either accepted or rejected from the environment itself. \n\nThe environment is aware. It will either accept or reject you, and the time which you are able to participate is determined by the deity of the dimension itself. (It is a living thing)- not to be confused by a 'god'. Its merely self aware and limits your capacity to entertain its presence... \n\nYou know in your heart that you've been aparty to something sacred and ancient. A lost civilization, and ruling. Potentially archaic, and expired. \n\nThere you will experience all that was, and is Atlantis. It is a factual dimension. It was never lost as a pair of keys could be; or like a child having been separated from his parents... \n\nIn fact you realize that you are the child and that: for the first tine in your life you've truly experienced something rare, unique, and genuine... \n\nSomething sacred\nSomething beyond all that you had ever fathomed beyond all wildest dreams... \n\nWhen you finally accept that you can  stay there for ever- your dimensions re-bond- you are dejected and fear and sorrow are restored to your emotional paradigm...\n\nYou feel all the antimosity of present existence suffocating you, and that suffocation is your body struggling to remeber to breathe, as your mind regains its earthern consciousness-\n\nYou were dead, yet in that death; You were omnipotent. If and only for a moment in time. \n\nWhile you can stay in Atlantis as long as you are welcomed- When and 'if' you are sent home. Whether it was an hour to a year that you experienced there-\nThe awakening shocks you because your consciousness 'here' can not account for the tine paradox. \n\nSometimes people stay there for years. \n\nYet the chemical here only lasts several minutes. Exasperating your oxygen until your body is forced to regain its operation. Or (in paradox) gives into the situation in its entirety. (Overdosing you). (Dead dead). \n\nThere are only 2 other chemical varities on earth that compare to this experience... \n\nWhat I did, and How I recieved it; are my own personal secrets that I will take to the grave with me...\n\n\nAtlantis is beautiful... \n\nI used to think the concept art was inherently poor in taste. I used to think it was a fools paradise, and an exploit on the public! Like believing in ghosts or flat earth...\n\nUntil the day I took this substance and truly arrived at something; (So much) bigger then me, that it's forever changed my outlook and perceptions on the entirety of our known universe. \n\nThis is like time travelling or the matrix. \n\nIt wasn't a 'mirage or trip'. \n\nIt was beyond anything I could attempt to tell you with you taking me seriously (word for word). \n\nI can only say what I have. \n\nBut I am no fool. My time is important to me, and had this truly not been worth typing. I'd not have written it at all...\n\nI am a scientifically minded well grounded person. \n\nThis was obvious to me the pairing of two dimensions on a single plain. \nNothing more, and nothing less. \n\nThat is what I saw- felt- &amp; experienced-\nI can't tell you anything more...\n\nSorry-\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Almost like its a black hole type of force field...............................................\n\n\nMy CRAZY theory:\n\n\nUpon death, we are likely still trapped within the prison, but within the astral state is likely when we have the opportunity to escape/grow out of the barrier. \n\nForced reincarnation may be bad, but it also may be a process of actually recharging/making sure souls don't become tainted/become destroyed/something else, it may be necessary if a person doesn't learn how to raise their vibrational state to place them back within a physical body to prevent the soul from dissipating. \n\n\nIt almost seems like whatever has us trapped, actually wants us to be able to leave, once we have grown enough in whatever way we don't currently comprehend. \n\nPeople who know they are unable to raise their state/are misled by their Brothers, likely submit to the fact that they know they will repeatedly reincarnate as they are too evil/unable to evolve/whatever, so now they just want to learn how to reincarnate the way they want. \n\nThis makes the ideology the Masons currently have (based upon my limited and likely flawed understanding, but nevertheless, a brotherhood in which their is misdirection and lies in the high ranks and the ones \"privy\" to this knowledge are likely given a higher ranking while they troll the ones who are unaware with riddles and fantastical poems that mislead or confuse them), dangerous as well, as one attempting to reach enlightenment, with whom the possibility may lie, may never be able to ascend/grow/whatever due to being lied to, for no other reason than to create a divide between Men, based upon social ranking, knowledge, wisdom, etc, its just more barriers to divide Men who should be brothers. \n\nI don't really understand whats happening in the world but I gave my theory.

Sometimes you can just feel it, some have feelings that they are overcome with dread/depression, they love that energy. Some entities do it in gangs and stick around until they are removed or you are aware and try to change your state of being/get happy.\n\n2. Then they don't bother you so much. Your energy is not attractive to bad ones. Good ones hang around when you're happy. Sometimes playing with your hair/caressing your face.\n\n3. You don't but I'm sure people are working on proof of this, I mean I want to prove the existence of ghosts but others are too.\n\n4.

Yet, there is a discernible, even radical, descent in regards to what must surely be a key barometer of the intellectual and imaginative capacities of the Empire, namely, the technoscientific complexity and organization of the official, institutional face and materiality/corporeality of the same, one that is most clearly seen in its, because best surviving, architectural dimension.

But an idiot can take the latter and imagine a table with like 10 people and that makes the discussion impossible. Where are factually presenting it as a coalition of alliances of bankers for example, or how the 1percent own most of the wealth and have enough of that wealth be invested in stocks in major companies, that is controlling stock, so they have a voice that shapes corporate movement and conversely social dimension. \n\nSo the real issue I see today is education really needs to be free, social burden, so that together as society we can have a better educated normal distribution to have the ability to discuss conspiracies and beliefs without stooping down to the level of bigfoot.

So lets say the Ice wall is real, it surrounds our globe and everything. Sure ill run with it: So how the fuck are fossils found in antarctica of temperate climate plants and animals? In other words, if Earth is flat, and its always been flat, how the fuck did dino bones get fossilized there? \nCuz this is what I know: Antarctica was positioned at roughly 70\u00b0S a few millions years ago, so the plants present \u2014 similar to those found in New Zealand and Tasmania today \u2014 suggest that the climate was relatively warm and temperate in the Late Mesozoic. \n\nExplain with your flat earth model how these fossils got there.\n\n",

Not only that, most people don't even use their logic. To top it off, you have to battle against years and years of indoctrination since birth. Look at you, you're absolutely baffled. how can someone believe we don't live on a globe! You've been showed that globe since before you could even had a chance to learn how to think. \n\n&gt;Why not just explain?  \n\nare you retarded. I've told you many times. it's like saying why don't you just tell me how TCP/IP works on a reddit comment. \n\n&gt;How does the Sagnac experiment prove Flat Earth \n\nIt doesn't you fucking moron. Michelson experiment proved earth is not moving it's stationary. Then that fucking moron Einstein comes along and eliminates ether and states nothing can go faster than speed of light.  Then Georges Sagnac comes along and  proves the existence of Aehter.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND?\n\n&gt;how the Moon Landing was faked? \n\nif you still believe in the moon landings then you probably believe in Santa and easter Bunny. Thats how stupid or childish you'd have to be. \n\n&gt;Why should I trust this Doug Merret when I can't find any outside information about him? \n\nYou shouldn't. You should take the information and use your brain.. oh nevermind. \n\n&gt; Why is this something on the website? (This conclusion is also consistent with our reason \u2013 given the millions of years that the mountain has been around, the summit of Pico del Teide should by now be several minutes in the future compared to the land at its sea shore base. And yet they are physically connected. To believe that time dilation is real would require us to assume that walking up the mountain is the same as walking into the future - the land would have to form a bridge between two points in Einstein\u2019s dimension of time.  It is somewhat trivial to travel to the top of the mountain and view through a telescope a clock tower in Puerto de la Cruz far below to verify that the top of the mountain and the sea side resort share the same present.)\n\nbecause that's what relativity wants you to believe. You're too stupid to even know how the current model that's being taught even works.  Do you know what special theory of relativity is even about? whats the difference between Special and General theory of relativity? of course you don't! quick. wiki it and read the first paragraph and tell yourself you grasp the idea. \n\n&gt;If that's the garbage I can expect, \n\nthats the garbage you actually believe without even knowing it. If you believe the current standards of astrophysics and cosmology that's literally what you believe! but again.. you don't know that because you're clueless. \n\n\n&gt;I'm not going to waste my time combing through every page in the hopes of finding scraps relevant to Flat Earth. Either link the relevant information, explain it or admit you can't.\n\nagain... not believing in the current model because it requires me to believe absurdities, like that mountain time difference, doesn't mean I believe in the genesis and bible and flat earth. I don't know where we are and how we came to be. I don't have answers for you. I just don't claim to know how everything started 14.5 BILLION years ago in a bigBang! hahahah you might as well believe in the virgin birth of Mary in a desert.\n\n&gt; Why would scientists lie about the shape of the Earth?\n\nThis is starting to become a bit more clear for me but it took years and years.  Here are some clues. Do you know who came up with the big bang theory? no. not hubble. No, not Einstein. that mother fucker has not a single original thought. then who? A little guy named George Lemaitre. don't mind him, he is just a humble jesuit priest.   HAHAHHAHAHAH fucking retards walking around poking fun of people who believe in a god and church, yet they themselves subscribe to an idea put forth by a jesuit. Can't make this shit up. Another thing you can make up! where did the first NASA administrator come from? Air force? Marines? was he a physicist? A rocket industry?  nope your boy T. Keith Glennan\ncame from Paramount pictures.  yes. the people who still make your movies.  now go back to lala land. \n\n\n\n",

The same trauma that causes these psychedelic experiences to go haywire. It's a tricky and delicate process indeed. We're figuring it out as we go, so I thank psychonaughts such as \"GOD-IS-DEMIURGE\" for attempting to break free and blaze a trail for those who aren't ready nor capable. And I also thank people such as yourself for making sure we do so intelligently and with caution. \n\nThis whole experience is just a game; Time vs. intensity. Ascension is inevitable; but that could be lifetimes or even moments away \n\nThe difference between Bone-shattering traumatic experiences and Intelligently-ecstatic Blissful experiences is razor-thin. We are figuring out how to stay on the \"high road\" while we \"walk back\" out of Time-Space into the 5th dimension, where our sentience has always, and will always, reside. \n\nSomething like that ;)",

The fear of flying may have been triggered when he and his father Kim Il-sung witnessed the explosion of their exclusive jet in midair in 1982.\n\nThe jet, imported from the Soviet Union, exploded in midair during a test flight. After being told that the accident was caused by the pilots' negligence, the Kims came to distrust North Korean pilots and disbanded their exclusive flight crew.\n\nKim Il-sung once traveled thousands of kilometers to the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact states in Eastern Europe. But Kim Il-sung still occasionally took a plane. In 1986 he visited Moscow to call on Mikhail Gorbachev for an urgent meeting but used a Russian pilot.\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "My friends,\n\n&gt; First off - we have no idea what the internal structure of a black hole is. It's actually the place where our physics breaks down.\n\n&gt; Since a blackhole is a \"blackbox\" no information that can describe the internal structure can escape\n\nLook at it this way. Our observable universe is a black hole, the singularity of that black hole is the big bang. We are describing the internal structure, day by day. I've known this since an early age, because there is an observable universe. At the edge of the observable universe is a boundary we cannot see beyond. It is a Schwarzschild radius, a cosmic event horizon. Zoom out enough on something and it disappears or takes a new form. Information from our observable universe cannot escape because it is in \"a black hole\", information would have to travel beyond the event horizon, which is expanding at the speed of light. You'd have to fast forward the information without fast forwarding anything else so that it catches up to the wavefront of expansion. So far this seems impossible, but holofractal implies new concepts that could make it possible. We won't know until we explore that.\n\n&gt; With consciousness you mean Divinity i guess (different names, same fuzzy thing). Aslong as you die, it aint.\n\n&gt; The You ceases to exist.\n\nI used to think that, but I no longer do. I used to be peacefully atheist/agnostic (Dawkins is a pain in the ass), but I can no longer say that I support that atheist viewpoint. Nor am I saying I switched from atheism to theism. Hear me out.\n\nI've looked at this from every angle I could research and imagine. The result is amazement. The more we look into things, the more we reveal the infinite nature of the universe and ourselves. At one point I fell into what they call an abyss, and then I came out on the other side. It was one of the best experiences I've had. Some call it enlightenment, others call it Kundalini awakening. Whatever. I know it exists now. We're on a journey. This is described by the monomyth or hero's journey. It isn't defined by it, only described by it. The monomyth is a pattern of the universe that we have discovered. Buddhism has the same concepts. Let go of your ego and ask the universe. The universe is out there, and it is also inside you.\n\n&gt; If you awaken from this illusion, and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death \u2014 or shall I say, death implies life \u2014 you can conceive yourself. Not conceive, but feel yourself, not as a stranger in the world, not as someone here on sufferance, on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental. What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself. So, say in Hindu mythology, they say that the world is the drama of God. God is not something in Hindu mythology with a white beard that sits on a throne, that has royal perogatives. God in Indian mythology is the self, Satcitananda. Which means sat, that which is, chit, that which is consciousness; that which is ananda is bliss. In other words, what exists, reality itself is gorgeous, it is the fullness of total joy.\n\n&gt; The Earth is not a big rock, infested with living organisms, anymore than your skeleton is bones infested with cells. The Earth is geological, yes, but this geological entity grows people. So the existence of people is symptomatic of the kind of universe we live in.\n\n-Alan Watts\n\n&gt; I AM THAT I AM\n\n&gt; THAT ISISIS ISISIS THAT\n\n&gt; NIGHT IS TO DAY AS DAY IS TO NIGHT\n\n&gt; WEIGHING IN BALANCE\n\n&gt; OF THE UPSIDE DOWN OF THE DOWNSIDE UP\n\n-Eht Namuh\n\n&gt; I think, therefore I am\n\n-Rene Descartes\n\nIMO, the abyss is that realm of thought, not where you get lost and confused and reprimanded by the universe, but it is where you experience the true nature of the universe and then everything starts to make sense. Past, present, future merge into one endless possibility which describes our existence. For example, we are just one planet out of trillions. There is another planet out there that is a mere million years older than ours. A million years isn't much as far as the universe is concerned, but it is huge as far as evolution and consciousness goes if we compare it to ourselves. There are thousands of these planets, older and younger than ours. On some of those planets there must exist life forms, evolving. Why wouldn't they? It is not even questionable to me that there might be \"aliens\" out there in space far more advanced than us, it is a fact provided to us by the universe and our ability to observe it. If you know the universe, then you will know this is a fact, not a fantasy. We are aliens to them. They are aliens to us. But we are all sharing in this same energy that has been set about by the cosmos, this energy that lets us see and touch matter, this radiation from energetic celestial objects that randomly or accidentally programs DNA \"code\" to eventually create us. But how could this be an accident? DNA aims to survive and evolve for its environment. The species of DNA consume each other in what is called the food chain or circle of life, and through consumption of DNA by other DNA-species, DNA evolves further and incorporates new traits about the environment. Viruses also program DNA. As far as we know this process has no end or final goal. Pretty much anything could happen. Have a look at some deep sea species, they are aliens. Our aliens. The abyss, and DNA, are like the ouroboros:\n\n&gt; It [ouroboros] also represents the infinite cycle of nature's endless creation and destruction, life and death.\n\nWhen you die, your friends and family remember you. How is that so? Because our consciousness is a shared energy, it is a crowd sourced affair that you might say exists in a higher dimension for lack of a better term. All of the ancient civilizations, through their religions, tried to comprehend this realm where thought happens and where experiences exist. Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity. They were attempting to explore and understand the unphysical. Heaven, akashic records, the spiritual plane, whatever you want to call it. We could not possibly evolve to the point we are at unless our consciousness was like this. Evolution trends towards higher consciousness. Why is that? Every past species we know of was a step in the right direction, until humans and collective consciousness arose out of this cosmic-DNA feedback loop, and from that, spawned intelligence. We cannot survive space. Machines can. The next step I believe is artificial intelligence. If our consciousness and intelligence can somehow be put into machines, we will evolve further and adapt to new environments besides Earth. We will become even closer to our maker, the maker of the stars, that which breathes life into the universe. This was the plan all along. It is the nature of the universe. It has already happened though, in another time and place, if only you understood the universe.\n\nEinstein still exists in our consciousness and he still shapes the way we look at physics. He is dead, but his concepts live on. His concepts were helped along by all the other conscious humans during his time period. It's a shared affair. We still have Sherlock Holmes shows on TV, because Arthur Conan Doyle imprinted himself into our collective consciousness through his spirituality and art of writing. You brush your teeth in the morning because other conscious beings discovered it to be a good way to maintain oral health. Everything about us is shared consciousness. When you're a baby, everyone helps you become conscious. Without that help, you do not become conscious on a human level. There are anomalies such as the wild children who grew up in the woods and lack the shared consciousness we have. Their consciousness lines up with wild animals, as this is the environment they live in. It is only when we conscious humans step into that person's life and attempt to teach them math and language that they \"join\" the collective consciousness the rest of us are all part of. So you see that consciousness cannot thrive or evolve without other consciousness helping out, and consciousness itself is an environment \"to be in\". You might ask yourself then, what helped out our consciousness?\n\nApologies for the wall of text, I'm working on better ways to describe this stuff. This isn't a copy paste so there might be some contradictions here and there, but I think the point has been made. There is so much more about this universe than what we know or think. We've barely scratched the surface. It makes me happy to be alive and able to experience it all for a while.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J7csNwXm0Y\n\nFarewell, alien human.",

The Dolzeal thing made me laugh and i have confounded some a typical business types with the way I walk and talk sometimes. Disassembly and understanding mechanisms of control were necessary for survival and came naturally.\n\nretrospect: looking now at where I was when things were out of my control shaping how and what i learn then and affecting the now has a double edge as my primary craft is shaping and manipulating video and motion graphics(since 2001) like a perception of time dance sortof....metaphor: a ships front is RELATIVE NORTH to everyone on board but the north pole is TRUE NORTH to the ship itself and everyone on board(this is important at sea when measuring angle and course of yourself and other ships)....I edit video on a timeline expanding and contracting time to make emotions or graphics mix together like a puzzle but the further in you go the harder it is to perceive true time(lost 8 months*)...now this is a talent many have..out west it can be identified young and passed on through generations but lets say Lenny Kravitz making a doritos commercial for money requires lenny to care only about the $ so enter moral compasses(lenny sees this as work so he doesnt care about anything but the check and doritos will drop him if he falls off but the JOB is to make you FEEL good about doritos so why do i care about any aspect or the result of it?)..so as I was new to LA i learned very quick that smoking weed was a kinda requisite of the post production craft for a transplant that is a kamikaze editor(Cole Trickle reference) like the cortizone needle is necessary for the athletes to get paid and that quality shit out there has silver surfer level stuff so time shift i was playing with before was like sheeeeiiiizzzle....i equate my edit sessions like Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow(beginning it was strange, after a while i figure out a rythym, i realize i'm playing with core code of people type shit and my huge beard become my only clock,something crazy by my standard happens**)...I knew about other people and other drugs but i was determined to set a pace with weed as I saw it as my only way thru(double edge one..people that win are ready to do the most and die trying..)..so i set up a schedule and set out to impress producers with skill...i found it wasn't the basic skill but the ability to create options and avenues that made me valuable and i had come to learn the people with the money cannot create something, they are following a paint by numbers system.  once my price got validated by that \"famous person\" the mind games began..silence was a better weapon than anything...my quest for understanding mechanisms of control could only come from the place and culture that is the base primary industry manufacturer of hopes and dreams here and across the world, los angeles.  Moving there in 2007 after many visits and immersing myself first hand into the culture and understanding the clockwork of how the \"feels\" machine works and drives things shows you how sex and money are used by world class manipulators.  \n\nNow first since i refer to 2007 lets just say I was lucky before that but never withing the sphere of my own control(not a clear perspective but highly technically sound) and with relatives they grew up with someone currently famous i had \"access\" where many truths became stranger than fiction.\n\nfamily siblings: i'm the crazy uncle apparently\n\npeople criticize some people that take things for face value\n-studied the clockwork of video creation, production, maniplation and driving force...TV and movies to me are what the hottest blonde women the average hetero male sees are to hugh hefner..hef would be like \"she has a mis-shapen toe, this one is too long in the torso\"..ya know suuuper critical so with TV and movies i see the recycled narratives that make the repacking of same shit.  \n\nThe best things i can leave here is to say that these are the things i find most important.\n\n#1 Peace of Mind and Physical Health\n#2 Access to vast amounts of knowledge and tools\n#3 The 3 Prime Directives outside of a pay me for time job i hate\n     A) Create something from nothing\n     B) Buy Low Sell High\n     C) Find \"Person/Company/etc 1\" selling to                             \n         \"Person/Company/etc 2\" and get in between them using A&amp;B\n     D) Try to make one choice lead to 3 or more options\n\n\"The Circumference of your understanding is limited to the diameter of your perception/perspective\" ~ Didjital (Unklejazzbo was given to me by a navy buddy)\n\nbtw: not saying the earth is flat or round but i have traversed this terrain over major sea manually and was trained to keep accurate course and distance measurements...easiest way to solve the debate is to buy alot of NOAA navigational charts..lay them out on football fields or bigger and do some measuring ... not here to argue with folks(i already know more than most)\n\nsome worth a look movies\nWhat Just Happened (Robert DeNiro)\nBranded (LeeLee Sobiesky)\nOvernight (Troy Duffy Documentary)\n*Dimension 404 - The Speedrun Episode\n**5 months into edit, smoke 1 day off 2 to reset\nusually don't remember dreams but saw 3 days into the future..shrugged it off and a week later it happened again..i took a break.\nFirst time i work, sleep, eat, shower, shit, work in a room with no windows and only 5 screens and two big computers(so many food deliveries) i usually don't remember dreams for a week or two after cease smoke..so i nap for 2 hours dream of when producer comes to pick up hard drive and we josh a little bit and he says something and on the way out the door he tosses me a keychain from a vacation he just got back from...i wake up and am like (well that was vivid..i dont leave the house and continue to work and 2 days later what i dreamed happened exactly to the point i said as he neared the door, \"where is my orange keychain?\" he looked and said i almost forgot..how'd you know it was orange.....total fkn groundhog day shit...so after a few days of whaaaaaat about 2 weeks later it happened again......changed routine and took a break...but one of the many things i thought was..what if what i did by accident someone is doing on purpose..sure would explain alot but perceptions of time is a motherf****r and Interstellar can suck an egg with their cosmic book shelf...\n\nThe world is magic to everyone except the magician - Anthony Hopkins in Westworld (which was good because its a new narrative about developing narratives) anyway i have typed alot..i usually dont and im not gonna check this soo input is appreciated, negativity gets the IKYABWAI response..(I know you are but what am I..last rule..find stupid shit to laugh at..analysis paralysis is a real thing and you can stalemate yourself like that dude in that room drawing circles in dark city)",

Why is this something on the website?:\n\n&gt;I'This conclusion is also consistent with our reason \u2013 given the millions of years that the mountain has been around, the summit of Pico del Teide should by now be several minutes in the future compared to the land at its sea shore base. And yet they are\u00a0physically connected. To believe that time dilation is real would require us to assume that walking up the mountain is the same as walking into the future - the land would have to form a bridge between two points in Einstein\u2019s dimension of time.\u00a0\u00a0It is somewhat trivial to travel to the top of the mountain and view through a telescope a clock tower in Puerto de la Cruz far below to verify that the top of the mountain and the sea side resort share the same\u00a0present.\n\n\nIf that's the garbage I can expect, I'm not going to waste my time combing through every page in the hopes of finding scraps relevant to Flat Earth. Either link the relevant information, explain it or admit you can't. Where is the proof of Flat Earth? How does Flat Earth explain the Sun shining on one side of the world while the other is experiencing night? Explain the science please. Why would scientists lie about the shape of the Earth?",

They did exist but they were magical creatures and didn't reproduce and have babies like a dinosaur or a lizard does, but existed in both the physical and spiritual worlds. I believe this about bigfoot as well. \n\nToday we can only think \"rationally\" or with thoughts based on material/physical observations as the only truth. Look up Walter Evans\\-Wentz book, The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries. The entire book is a recollection of \"stories\" told to the author about the fairy world. No one ever provides proof for these stories yet these people who saw the little people can't all be lying...not every one of them. And what benefit does it have for us to binarily reject good people's observations simply based on the fact that \"we don't have any proof\"? Sure we can steel ourselves from liars and con\\-artists but these people in the book who saw the fairies were not those people. We need new ways of thinking and not simply trying to explain everything with materialistic scientific concepts.\n\nThis book is a good example of how we can think outside of materialistic thinking.  We are always trying to cast every single spiritual event or legend or folklore cryptid into a living breathing animal that we just missed in our zoological classification. That it is just hiding somewhere on the earth and that we have not dug deep enought to find the remains of the creature. Nope sorry.\n\nThere will never be \"proof\", materialistic, phsyical proof, for the existence of spiritual beings because they never were purely physical beings like the dinosaurs or human beings, they were spiritual or at least had one foot in another dimension.",

In short, the universe, us, our brains, are all holograms and with this Gateway device they were able to combine the two hemispheres of the brain and access a higher dimension outside of time and space, as such, the universal consciousness that they interacted with in that dimension exists in all times and places simultaneously and we come from and return to it when we die with ur memories intact, but lose free will due to the nature of our holographic brains needing time to exist in order to operate. While a part of the \"All Together\" as I think they called it you also have access to everyone else's memories too. Supposedly other entities exist in that dimension as well, my memory is a little hazy. It was all pretty crazy, but it ties in well with what you were talking about.

The way the theories go is that Mars used to be a thriving planet that had a very advanced civilization, but a war broke out and they completely destroyed everything. This war forced them to go underground to be able to survive. \n It really seems as if our planet is heading in that direction. And at the same time it seems as if Mars is improving.

There would be no reason to access \"someone's\" else record because YOU are not interested in \"someone\" else. Your Essence, your soul is here to learn for YOURSELf. \nIt is not something you can 'own'. \nLook. \nOn Earth we are bound by our personality and Ego. As we die our Egos dies and our energy is return to the astral plane in our energy bodies also called souls. Your perspective on the Astral is vastly different then from here. And beyond all the 7 dimensions which we traverse in the journey from and to Tao our essence resides and our essence is Tao expanded. \n\nMaybe this helps. \nTao casts itself into essence which can be seen as a \"spark of Tao\". Tao does this to expand itself and 'create' a lens in which to view. Essence then casts itself into a soul to be able to traverse in denser dimensions. To traverse the \"Spiritual Tree\" so to speak, the 7 dimensions of this \"Spiritual Tree\" is an opportunity for Tao to experience itself in an ever-lasting process of Creation and Growing. \n\nThe Physical Plane is the most dense dimension. Currently this Planet is \"inhabited\" by Gaia. Gaia is a soul or consiouness that is as aware as you or me, well, more aware because of the larger body basically. The soul then \"plants\" itself into a physical body to experience the physical plane. \nLayer upon Layer is 'filtered' through the lens so that the experience of Creation is lived and all retunerd to Tao to then be refined and cast again. \n\nOne journey through the all of the 7 dimensions is called a Grand Cycle. One cycle in the physical plane is divided into 5 stages. Infant Soul, Baby Soul, Young Soul, Mature Soul and Old Soul. Each soul age has 7 stages. Currently the majority of Humans on Earth is in the Young Soul age and in aprox 50 years we will turn the corner into Mature Soul. Everything happening in the World is the turning to this event. Alot of souls in the higher dimensions is working to assist Earth and Humanity in this. \n\nWhen the soul reach the last stage of Old Soul the soul 'cycles off' the planet and has completed the first dimension. The soul then continues up to the higher astral Plane to learn there. Onwards it goes untill Soul reunites with other souls into a WE formation and eventually the Soul is reabsorbed into Essence and Essence into Tao. \n\n\n\n",

You are supposed to be trained as a good american to refuse to see or acknowledge even the most obvious conspiracies.  \n\nThis is why the entire american media is obsessed with collusion, which is the same thing as a conspiracy.  They can't admit it, after all this, now all they can do every day is talk about how everything is a big conspiracy of one kind or another.  \n\nMeanwhile the military bombs freely on the map in Syria and no american(even the soldiers preparing to be sacrificed i suspect) has any clue what is going on over there whatsoever except her da der 9/11 never agin!  \n\nI do not think it is possible to have politics without conspiracy and a conspiracy without a political dimension is actually difficult to imagine.  Even mice conspire in some circumstances.  Wolves in a pack may conspire.  \n\nYou are allowed to conspire in a political campaign over what your messaging will be and when you propose legislation in congress.  It's' not an absoslute thing.  \n\nThere is simply a space in human culture and society where people need to think freely and look at the actual connections behind the scenes, which we know very well to be well crafted veneers like the paint job on a Trump construction project.  \n\nThis should it be shameful, oh you're one of those, or oh you are talking about the conspricy woo woo needs to stop.  it's just a part of thinking.  \n\nNot all conspiracies are bad, anyone who says there aren't any bad and/or important ones though is trying to control your brain and that is not going to go well for you and yours.  \n\nThe question is, can you say something intelligent about the problems?  \n\nOr just as good, what do you think is the most important issue affected by the worst secret?  \n\n",

This is according to the mystery traditions. After life we do not have the same power to exercise our free will and it is important to realize that. \n\nOne of the main reasons the Christ came down to earth was to give us the ability to control our destinies as mankind had become very corrupt and was not heading towards a desirable future. This would not have been necessary if \"nothing mattered\" in relation to your moral/ethical life on earth because the Christ could have waited until the after life to \"save\" us...but He did not.  \n\nYour serial killer anology is a good one except...heinous acts have the power to prolong your after life in a hell dimension while you \"pay for what you have done\". Yes you will be reborn but you might be reborn in Africa and get hacked to death at 3 years old...you might have to be reborn as a fetus soon to be aborted, repeatedly until you have burnt off your karma. I am only hypothesizing here but my point is that it very much does matter what you do here on Earth. \n\nYour soul does not have as much free will as it does here on Earth. This is a mystery tradition spiritual truth...not even the angels or the archai or the archangels have as much free will as we have on earth. It sounds strange but its true. Angels are under the authority of higher powers and do not choose to help or hinder, they only do what they are told.",

I kind of have a feeling that when we die more than live in these separate universes that the ones that are still alive will be more drawn to death itself. I don't think our consciousness \"collects\" into one body though. Especially if there are multiple selves. I think when we die these parts of consciousness go beyond our dimension into one where space and time are irrelevant,meaning when we died no matter where or when our consciousness would collect at this point and seem instant in every reality for everyone. In our observable reality tho. I think maybe crazy and suicidal people may have died too many times across these universes and are missing the whole of themselves in this other dimension. ",

            "body": "Entertaining wild ideas is fine, but you should have some kind of rational basis for entertaining the idea in the first place. I don't entertain the idea that unicorns from another universe control America from a bunker in the 6th dimension, because I have no rational reason to. Let's examine the rationality of this statement:\n\n&gt;sine wave looks like a serpent, like Satan. Also reminds me of the Uroboros (the snake biting it\u2019s own tail to representing infinity) Kind of a stretch, but the Bible also tells us we die because of sin.. or is it sine? What if sine wave is another way of saying time wave? Saying we die because of sin could really mean we die because of time, which is true. Now we\u2019re told time is money and money is time - well turn the sine wave on its side and it looks like a $. Now who runs this world? The love of money is the root of all evil\n\nLet's start with:\n\n&gt;sine wave looks like a serpent, like Satan.\n\nWhy not a legless lizard, worm, or other similarly shaped specie? Why a serpent specifically? There is no rationale here, merely a similarity in form between the two, and zero logical reason to \"connect\" these dots.\n\n&gt;the Bible also tells us we die because of sin.. or is it sine?\n\nIt was sin. The etymology of the word sin is likely latin for sont, or \"guilty\". Sine has nothing to do with that, sine comes from latin for \"sinus\" or \"curved\". The similarities between the two are cursory and only related in the english language, which the bible had zero relation to, and zero basis in. This proposition has no logical basis.\n\n&gt;What if sine wave is another way of saying time wave?\n\nAs far as I know, there is no relation between sine and time. May as well say, \"what if sine wave is another way of saying spaghetti meatball sub wave?\"\n\n&gt;Saying we die because of sin could really mean we die because of time, which is true.\n\nWe don't die because of time, we just stop passing through the temporal dimension known as time, as sentient human beings with material bodies, as far as science can discern. This has nothing to do with time, except in regards to the relationship between the repeated replication of human cells across many generations, which are tracked by the replication of those cells over time. If you could put a person into cryostasis, and you did so for a million years, they'd still be alive when you took them out of stasis, despite having been \"alive\" for a million years. Time didn't kill this theoretical person, and it isn't what is responsible for your death, or anyone's death for that matter. Time is no more responsible for death than the spatial dimensions. Even if that statement were true, which it isn't, it wouldn't mean anything, because the previous statement, which came before it, had no logical basis. If you take \"we die because of sin\" or \"sine\" to mean \"we die because of time\" in that, we die as our organisms attempt to remain alive over a period of time and fail to continue to do so over a certain period of time, something like 60+ years, then okay. So what, nothing that came before that statement has any remote basis in logic, and those statements themselves are not logically related in any way, either. I may as well be saying, \"we die as a result of sin, but what if that means, we die as a result of Shrimp Scampi?\"\n\n&gt;Now we\u2019re told time is money and money is time - well turn the sine wave on its side and it looks like a $.\n\nAgain what logical connection exists here? Is there a reason to suggest that there is some kind of esoteric or metaphysical connection between the dollar sign and the sine wave? You know what also looks like a sine wave? The letter \"S\". Is there an esoteric connection between the letter \"S\" and \"sine\"? No? Why not? Time is money is a pretty common saying, sure. Maybe this would mean something if there was some relationship between sin and sine, and then sine and time, but none of this was established on a logical or scientific basis of any kind. Here, I can do this, too.\n\nWell, you've heard the saying, \"the straw that broke the camel's back, right?\" Well, what about the **paw** that broke the camel's back. Paws are like feet. I know it's a stretch, but we know it takes a great feat to turn a desperate situation around, and feat is like \"feet\" so what if it really means, \"the feat that broke the camel's back\" and it's actually not meant to mean \"the final straw\" but rather, \"the last second savior\". See. None of that makes any sense and you shouldn't believe any of it without evidence.\n\n&gt;Now who runs this world? The love of money is the root of all evil.\n\nThe love of money is not the root of all evil. Trust me, some of the worst, most savage, inhuman acts, have been carried out by people with no regard to money. The human condition is the root of all evil. Evil is within all of us. The Nazis were you and I, no different. This is gibberish that leads you away from the truth, because it leads you away from using your rational mind to discern truth. It's negligent at best, and destructive at worse.\n",

In this dimension our Natural Human power will be substituted by artificial tech and we will be monitored, influenced and manipulated every second of our existance.

This sounds exactly like \"were all in a VR sim\", how have I not heard of this or anyone mention it before with all this matrix talk. One thing that struck me is when he said \"there is another world ontop of us\" and how its just one VR sim stacked ontop of the other..... this was actually a thought I had on my own after doing a bunch of random research, like parallel realities in this huge column. I almost feel like it was a mental suggestion... and very well true. I got this theory that the whole \"civilization ending catastrophe\" that cycles every 10 thousand years or whatever that you hear about is when the dimension ontop of us crashes down ontop of us, forming the next layer of earth..... tons of people don't make it aside from certain groups or safe spots.... and oddly enough, this might be happening soon, or so it feels to me (tho hopefully I am wrong).... all I know is they talk about huge solar flares, lots of odd weather this year, plant growth has been insane and abundant, and the clouds all seem way closer to the ground as well as much stranger and unique formations then ever before. I swear I feel like I have hopped into a different dimension a few years ago, but esp this past year. ",

You can be positive or negative. Reality is far more then the 3 dimensions we exist in. If a being is positive enough and has mastered his mind he can somehow ascend into higher dimensions. As i understood it, there is a god that created this earth but also gods that created other worlds. Themselfes being created by other beings and so on until you finally reach the one god, the singularity, the whatver that compartmentalized himself snd gave consciousness to these parts, in order to experience creation and creativity and as a kind of test. The singularity god is like pure love/light/wisdom/positivity... in order for the compartmentalized parts to have free will, there is a dire need for an opposite force. So satan(any bad entity is there for a reason. They are there so humans can actively choose between the good and the evil while they exist in human form. In between earthly lives, the soul return to the earths soul (earth god?) and experience oneness. It is there that they can rejoin with their loved ones, access sll the memories from their live, their past lives and all the memories of the conscious-grid they belong to, if the others choose to share them. It is ones own choice to stay in this \u201eafterlive\u201c, \u201eascend to a higher dimension\u201c or \u201ereincarnate\u201c again to test themselves again in an earthly live. While you incarnate on earth you normally dont have other memories but i think it ties in with some people being able to remeber past lives. For the bad entities: while in this afterlive, you can also actively choose to become a bad force, also serving the purpose of \u201egod\u201c as the ultimate sacrifice to offer free will. Its merely just a role in their incarnation but also another test for themselves. Some fall to lover density dimension, some still ascend into higher dimension, even though it is harder for them to be all positive again afterwards. Demons are just lover density/ dimensional beings, wheres angels are higher dimensional beings or beings with higher frequency then us. ",

The notion that the velocity of light in a vacuum was constant regardless of the motion of any object connected with the light ray by Hendrik Lorentz.

Did he even come up with the name relativity? NO! that was Poincare. How about no velocity can exceed the speed of light? Nope! Poincare! How about that whole clock business? you know, the fact that if you go at the speed of light, you age slower than if you stood on earth? NOPE That was actually Sir Joseph Larmor. Was he the one who came up with matter crinkles curved space? sorry to say no. That was actually William Kingdon Clifford. okok.. what about E=MC2? nope. J. J. Thomson came up with E = 3/4 MC2 and then later on our buddy Poincare came up with E=MC2 when he spoke to mass density in relation to energy density.

If a 2D ant were to walk in a circle, it would think it is walking infinitely straight forever because it has no conception of spheres. That\u2019s why our 3D universe seems infinite when in reality it\u2019s probably totally different to the 4th dimension. \n\nPlus, we still haven\u2019t figured out a lot of things at subatomic level, and many people speculate it\u2019s because eventually it\u2019s just pixels/qubits, however that\u2019s speculation obviously which is why I mentioned it second, as I can\u2019t confirm or deny that as we don\u2019t know. \n\nBut it seems very likely, and be that as not a fact, but try to you look at the world around you and really analyze what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll start to see what I\u2019m referring to simulation-wise. \n\nDMT helps too, which while I have not tried yet, have researched a lot and seems to help you connect beyond the simulation to your true soul, but then again, all speculation.\n\nHope that helps you understand where I\u2019m coming from.

Hell, I believe in the membrane theory where there's thousands, millions of dimensions (okay so far only like 10 have been theorized with incredible evidence), much like the string theory as well. Perhaps, in one of those dimensions everything is flat. Flat earth, flat moon, flat mars- Jupiter-sun-Uranus all that jazz. However, for this specific dimension that we currently reside in, it is not flat. That's the closest I can come to a mutual agreement with a flat earther. \n\nFor right now, people who fly planes, survey engineers/ground surveyors, long range ballistic calculations, and sailors all utilize known laws and theories to navigate and accurately build structures or drop bombs/bullets. If the earth was flat, the methods they use to succeed in their jobs would fail every single time. They do calculate the slight curvature between short distances and long distances- they would fail. There's no way that these people would calculate the curvature for short or long distances, and the supervisor or CEO come in and swap calculations for flat earth model...\"to keep them in the dark about the real flat earth\" c'mon now.

Most people who are dogmatic about science can't tell you what 'standard deviation' means, but they are completely confident in a number of scientific conclusions that I find preposterous.\n\nLike... plate techtonics, global warming, and the composition of the sun. They say things like, \"You know, we are living in a 9 dimensional universe, and I agree with the Copenhagen interpretation\". \n\nNO YOU DON'T! You have FAITH in those things, but you can't even imagine what a 9 dimension universe even means.\n\nSome of the conclusions of science are downright wacky. Schrodenger created a thought experiment to show just how daffy QM is, and most people think he was trying to EXPLAIN QM with the thought experiment.\n\nMaybe there is an ether... maybe not... but at least we know the speed of light is constant, except for when it is not.",

Just like bigfoot is said to exist in a different dimension or reality which is why the stories tell of its ability to appear / disappear.  Most native people that believe in them won't discuss them or even use their native word for stick indians - it's often avoided and is taboo to discuss.  It's best not to talk about them, and not to utter their name.\n\nThe stick indians hang out in the forest and like to play tricks on people if you get their attention.  If they find you amusing then they may behave benevolently, but if you annoy them they're said to do awful things and will try to kill you.  You can get their attention by whistling in the woods, disrespecting the plant and animal life, or even thinking about stick indians.  That's the hard part as its tough not to think about something when you're specifically told not to.  They can read your thoughts so you have to try and purge your mind and heart as best as possible before setting off.\n\nThe stick indians save their primary fuckery for the night time, but it can happen during the day as well.  They're said to trick people away from camp by emulating familiar sounds, often described as a group of people laughing and chatting with each other.  You get the impression that everything is okay and that you should go investigate the source of the sounds.  But that's how they get you.  Sometimes they'll kill and eat you, other times you'll just disappear completely without a trace.  If you ever hear sounds in the woods that seem intriguing but out of place you should never investigate them [particularly after dark].\n\nThere's more to it, but that's what comes to mind right now.  I suppose they're sort of like the native version of evil leprechauns.",

Everybody can visualize the classic \"greys\", and the more modern idea of reptilians, but I think that life exists on a level that we cannot physically see--not completely, anyways.\n\nI believe that a number of UFO sightings are, indeed, spacecraft--but I also believe that a number of them are literal living things. I've actually had a personal experience like this, where I saw a light in a tree that seemed to know it was being watched, and it moved back and forth behind the leaves as I turned my head to watch it more.\n\nWhere these so-called \"intelligences\" originate from doesn't even totally matter to me; they could be from the moon, or from a dimension on our own Earth that we cannot normally see. They could always be existing right beside us, just like the flora and fauna we CAN see.\n\nWhere I'm going with all of this is, just like you said: They could be intelligent and capable of communication on a human level, but it could be extremely complicated for them to do so by conventional means--or even well-known esoteric means! I've heard many tales of other lifeforms communicating with humans via ESP or dreams, and I believe those stories.\n\nAnd so, going off of your idea a bit here, I could absolutely see some kind of life form existing that cannot speak, not vocally or even with ESP necessarily, but a life form that IS capable of higher thinking, and IS capable of communication on a human level, and therefore has to do it in really weird complicated ways that barely make sense to us.\n\nIt could be that there IS life on the moon, and it IS among us here on Earth. And maybe it can only communicate digitally, through radio waves or even through LIGHT. After all, us humans have discovered some pretty bizarre ways of communication outside of speaking and writing. I'm currently conveying my ideas to you via digital input on a computer, and my words are being illuminated to you on bright lights.\n\nI could go on--just saying, I totally hear ya :)",
