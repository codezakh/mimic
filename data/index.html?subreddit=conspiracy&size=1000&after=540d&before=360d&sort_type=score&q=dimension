            "body": "&gt; In 1772, following in the footsteps of both his father and godfather, Adam Weishaupt became a professor of law at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria. Law was never his real passion, though. At just twenty-four years of age, Weishaupt was restless and idealistic. Disillusioned with his strict, mechanical Jesuit education, and inspired by the blossoming Enlightenment, he had developed a headstrong ambition to improve society using the power of reason to dispel religious superstition. He was also a \u201ccynical and unscrupulous careerist and liar,\u201d the historian John Roberts wrote; \u201cAll the evidence of this period of his career reveals him as a familiar hazard of academic and collegiate life: the clever, cantankerous, self-absorbed and self-deceiving bore.\u201d\n\n&gt; According to Roberts, Weishaupt\u2019s true passion was for intrigue. From an early age, he had been fascinated by secret societies like the Pythagorean Brotherhood. He joined a Masonic lodge in 1774, but found himself disappointed by the Freemasons\u2019 lack of political aspirations or genuine secrecy, and by the high membership fees. He decided to start a secret society of his own. The inaugural meeting was held on May 1, 1776, with just Weishaupt and four of his students in attendance. He called it the Order of the Illuminati.\n\n&gt; Weishaupt\u2019s dual personality was woven into the fabric of the Illuminati. Its philosophy was idealistic to the point of na\u00efvet\u00e9. The sole goal of the order, according to the statutes Weishaupt drew up, was \u201cto render unto man the importance of the perfection of reason and his moral character . . . to oppose the wicked designs in the world, to assist against the injustice suffered by the unfortunate and the oppressed, to encourage men of merit, and in general to facilitate the means of knowing and science.\u201d On the other hand, being the supreme leader of his very own secret society allowed Weishaupt to indulge his taste for attention and subterfuge. He carefully curated an aura of mystery for his sect. Initiates were required to take false names, learn a secret vocabulary, go through an elaborate set of initiation rites, and were instructed to sever ties with family and friends. To recruit new initiates, Weishaupt had Illuminati members infiltrate Masonic lodges and pick off their members. Weishaupt developed an elaborate hierarchy, which was itself concealed from all but the most senior members. Advancement required complete, unquestioning obedience. The true political goals of the order\u2014the peaceful transformation of society\u2014were only gradually revealed as a member climbed up the many ranks.\n\n&gt; By the early 1780s, the order had gained around three hundred members spread across Europe. But the expansion came at the cost of secrecy. Weishaupt\u2019s pedantic, domineering personality rubbed some recruits the wrong way. A few members spilled the beans about Illuminati activity to nonmembers, often with alarming exaggerations. By 1784, rumors about the order had caught the attention of the authorities. The Bavarian government issued an edict banning unauthorized associations, and Weishaupt suspended the Illuminati\u2019s meetings. Material continued to leak, and scurrilous rumors were increasingly published by journalists and repeated by preachers, accusing the Illuminati of \u201cirreligion, disloyalty to the dynasty, political intrigue and moral corruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; In a last-ditch effort to exonerate his order, Weishaupt personally approached Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, and told him most of the Illuminati\u2019s secrets. It proved to be in vain. On March 2, 1785, Theodore issued another edict, specifically condemning the Illuminati. Weishaupt fled Bavaria. Investigations commenced, arrests were made, and masses of the Illuminati\u2019s secret documents, including Weishaupt\u2019s personal letters, were published for all to see. The Illuminati was gone\u2014but not forgotten.\n\n&gt; The discovery of a very real secret society with very real political aspirations, combined with the many horribly embellished rumors about its sordid, subversive activity, was a recipe for confusion and alarm. Already it was rumored that Weishaupt\u2019s secret society continued to operate, and had simply gone underground. Freed from the hassle of actually existing, the Illuminati grew to mythic proportions in the fretful imaginations of its critics\u2014not only in Bavaria, but across Europe and as far afield as the newly independent United States. The exposure of Weishaupt\u2019s Illuminati tarnished the reputation of the Freemasons, too. A few lodges really had been infiltrated, after all\u2014and who was to say that all the Illuminati operatives had been ferreted out. The conspiratorial machinations of subversive secret societies increasingly looked like a viable explanation for troubling events. And then the French Revolution happened.\n\n&gt; \u201cIt is very easy today to underrate the emotional shock of the French Revolution,\u201d Roberts notes. \u201cBecause it opened an era of revolution in which we still live, we are used to the idea of revolution in a way in which the men of the eighteenth century were not.\u201d Over the course of ten violent, chaotic years, between 1789 and 1799, the age-old ways of hereditary aristocratic privilege crumbled, to be replaced with a new, more egalitarian, secular society. The revolutionary ideas began to spread across Europe, and soon millions of people had been granted basic human rights that they had never before enjoyed, while the aristocracy suddenly found their power and wealth decimated. It was a profound and unprecedented transformation\u2014the rapid emergence of an entirely new political reality. People understandably struggled to come to terms with it. \u201cThe scale and violence of the changes . . . seemed to exhaust all conventional and familiar categories of explanation,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cSome new dimension of understanding was needed.\u201d\n\n&gt; At the tail end of the Revolution, in 1797, two authors published, almost simultaneously, books that provided that new dimension of understanding. One was Augustin de Barruel. Barruel was a French nobleman, an ordained Jesuit priest, and a polemicist. He had already earned some literary success for his publications criticizing the Enlightenment philosophy, based on his staunch religious views. In 1789, the year the French Revolution broke out, Barruel had published a pamphlet blaming it on the corrupting ideology of the Enlightenment and the weakness of the French clergy. But by 1797, when he published the first two volumes of his Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism, Barruel had become convinced that the whole thing had actually been carefully engineered from behind the scenes. \u201cEven the most horrid deeds perpetrated during the French Revolution, every thing was foreseen and resolved on, was premeditated and combined,\u201d he wrote; \u201cthey were the offspring of deep-thought villainy.\u201d The villains, he claimed, included the Enlightenment Philosophes, the Freemasons, and the Jacobins. But these groups, Barruel wrote, were only the \u201cmost obvious villains in a great plot whose authors and agents have been far longer at work and are far more widespread.\u201d Lurking behind them all, coordinating the whole scheme, Barruel said, was an even more powerful, sinister enemy: Adam Weishaupt\u2019s dreaded Illuminati, whose \u201caim is not merely the destruction of the French monarch but universal dissolution, the overthrow of society and religion itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; Scotsman John Robison, a professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, had the same idea. He published his book shortly after Barruel, under the snappy title Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the Secret Meetings of Free-Masons, Illuminati and Reading Societies, etc., Collected from good authorities. Though Robison disagreed with Barruel over a few of the details, his premise was the same. The Illuminati was behind the French Revolution, he said, and it was only their first step toward inciting total, worldwide anarchy. According to Robison, the Illuminati leaders \u201cdisbelieved every word that they uttered, and every doctrine that they taught . . . Their real intention was to abolish all religion, overturn every government, and make the world a general plunder and a wreck.\u201d In case his readers weren\u2019t alarmed enough, Robison warned that the Illuminati \u201cstill exists, still works in secret . . . Its emissaries are endeavoring to propagate their detestable doctrines among us.\u201d\n\n&gt; Nothing Barruel or Robison had to say was particularly original, Roberts notes. Even since the earliest years of the Revolution, rumors had circulated that the Masons or some other secret sect had a hand in it. Robison and Barruel\u2019s genius was not for invention, but integration. They took all the existing plot theories and wove them together into a single grand theory. It not only explained the entire French Revolution, but had the potential to explain just about anything that had happened in the world, past, present, or future. The clear, comprehensive conspiracy theory Barruel and Robison articulated resonated perfectly with the fears and needs of the moment. Despite being riddled with factual errors and logical missteps, both books were quickly reprinted, translated, and exported around Europe and across the Atlantic to America.\n\n",

This assessment confirmed the approximate number of 325 magnetic data tape reels that each measured 14\" in diameter with a magnetic tape dimension of \u00bd\u201d and contained by a metal reel. The assessment also showed that the magnetic tapes were in poor condition and almost all were affected by moderate to severe mould, which is identified as a health risk. Most of the tapes were not labelled and of the tapes that were labelled, the content appeared to be space science related with missions including Pioneer and Helios and the inclusive dates range was 1961-1974. A final assessment of the tapes on April 3, 2016 further broke down of the content of the tapes into the following:\n\n    PN8 [Pioneer 8]: 1 reel\n\n    PN9 [Pioneer 9]: 2 reel\n\n    PN10 [Pioneer 10): 40 reels\n\n    PN11 [Pioneer 11]: 53 reels\n\n    HELl [or] HEL-A [Helios 1]: 10 reels\n\n    HESA [possibly an abbreviation for Helios A]: 2 reels\n\n    Intelsat IV: 2 reels\n\n    Unlabelled or labelled without mission-related identifying information: approximately 215 reels\n\n",

            "body": "I have schizophrenia and I'm heavily medicated in order to function on a somewhat normal level. \n\nWhen I believed in God and demons and the super natural it was much harder to stay grounded. It was much harder to differentiate between real and not.  Now that I firmly do not believe in any of the above, I can better observe my hallucinations and call them what they are. Hallucinations. \n\nUnfortunately, even medicated I have days where I will fall into a delusion.  Recently, my local grocery store did some remodeling.  It's the only store that I can grocery shop at by myself. I walked to find them halfway through remodeling and my mind twisted itself into thinking that they had rewired the entire store to watch me like the Truman show and I almost started raging at the customer service desk. Thankfully my husband was there to talk me through it and the manager knew me since childhood (I've had schizophrenia since 6 years old and the store hadn't been remodeled since it had been built in 1989 and this happened a month ago) and she came and talked with me about the remodeling and why it needed to be done and was very patient with me.\n\nSchizophrenia is very real and is not a manufactured diagnosis.  Coherently, I do not believe I can speak with another dimension or with souls or I'm possessed or any of those things. To believe in those things would cause me to be less grounded and more susceptible to other illogical delusions.  My day is spent playing a logic game. Does this make sense? Could this happen? What is the likely hood of this happening? Is anyone else seeing this? Etc.   ",

            "body": "&gt;and the cause of this is the tides\n\nAnd, there is where you went wrong. I'm going to slightly change the wikipedia explanation to make it more clear in this context\n\n&gt;The gravity of [Earth] produces a tidal force on [the Moon] that distorts its gravitational equilibrium shape slightly so that it becomes elongated along the axis oriented toward [Earth], and conversely, is slightly reduced in dimension in directions orthogonal to this axis. These distortions are known as tidal bulges. When [the Moon was] not yet tidally locked, the bulges travel[ed] over its surface, with one of the two \"high\" tidal bulges traveling close to the point where [Earth] is overhead.\n\n...\n\n&gt;The material of [the Moon] exert[ed] resistance to this periodic reshaping caused by the tidal force. In effect, some time [was] required to reshape [the Moon] to the gravitational equilibrium shape, by which time the forming bulges [had] already been carried some distance away from the [Earth\u2013Moon] axis by [the Moon]'s rotation. Seen from a vantage point in space, the points of maximum bulge extension [were] displaced from the axis oriented toward [Earth].\n\n...\n\n&gt;Because the bulges [were] displaced from the [Earth-Moon] axis, [Earth]'s gravitational pull on the mass in them exert[ed] a torque on [the Moon]. The torque on the [Earth]-facing bulge act[ed] to bring [the Moon]'s rotation in line with its orbital period, whereas the \"back\" bulge, which faces away from [Earth], acted] in the opposite sense. However, the bulge on the [Earth]-facing side is closer to [Earth] than the back bulge by a distance of approximately [the Moon]'s diameter, and so experience[d] a slightly stronger gravitational force and torque. The net resulting torque from both bulges, then, [was] always in the direction that acted to synchronize [the Moon]'s rotation with its orbital period, leading eventually to tidal locking.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking#Mechanism\n\nSo no, the change in the tides on Earth have nothing to do with tidal locking of the Moon, and will have no affect on it. It may have an affect on the tidal locking of Earth to the moon, but that is expected to take so long anyway, that the Sun will become a red giant and engulf them both before it happens.\n",

It's not remotely suspicious that people won't invade their own privacy just to satisfy your curiosity.\n\n&gt; just as they didn't ignore the leaked Trump pussy-grabbing tape. That was also an invasion of his privacy,\n\nNo, it wasn't.  And the fact that you do not comprehend this indicates a lack of any real concept as to what privacy is.\n\nIf you have agreed to be recorded and allowed a microphone to be fixed to you by another party for that purpose and you have agreed that they own the resulting audio produced, it is not an invasion of privacy for them to release that audio.\n\n&gt; People shouldn't have released that tape,\n\nWhy not?  He knew he was being recorded - they put a fricking mic on him for just that purpose.  He doesn't own the resulting audio.  How is it an invasion of privacy when he has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the information and doesn't own it anyway?\n\n&gt; but once they're out you can't bury your head in the sand and pretend you didn't see what you saw.\n\nYou don't have to be nosy about peoples' business.  You can very easily decide that it's not actually your business what these people mean in their private correspondence with each other.  And nothing requires you to frame someone's refusal to further invade their own privacy (after having already had it criminally invaded) to satisfy your curiosity about something that is none of your business as somehow being suspicious.  Many people like their privacy - it's not remotely suspicious that someone would refuse to further invade it having had it criminally invaded, all just to satisfy your curiosity.\n\n&gt; This isn't a court of law where there are rules for legally gathering evidence.\n\nThis isn't a tv show either.  These people are not characters for your entertainment.  They, their lives, their correspondence do not belong to you and are not your business.  They don't owe you an explanation about anything.  You owe them an apology for your complete lack of decency and basic fundamental human respect.  You're treating these people like they are objects for your gratification and not as though they are human beings with all that entails in their own right.  You're treating them like spectacles of entertainment with no regard for their human right and need for privacy.  This has nothing to do with courts of law and everything to do with basic, every day human decency.  Your attitude toward these people and their right to privacy which is intimately intertwined with their fundamental human dignity is just plain indecent.\n\n&gt; including the Hillary laughing about rape tape\n\nFor crying out loud.  The right to privacy and the connection between privacy and fundamental human dignity are enough reasons in themselves (ample reason) to not make further disclosures when in such a position, but the tendency of people like you to do shit like this adds a secondary dimension.  Such gross and despicable mischaracterizations are all too common.  The truth doesn't set people free so long as people like you are involved.  Characterizing laughing at a kind of technology as laughing at rape is disgusting.  When the world is full of people so indecent they would launch such dishonest, unfair, and malicious attacks, it's no wonder people are reluctant to release information to those people.  Who knows what lies they will make up about it.  With people like you around, further invading ones own privacy to satisfy the curious isn't going to stop people saying gross and untrue stuff about you so why sacrifice your privacy to hand them more ammunition for mischaracterization?",

It delves into Gnosticism and the concept of \"Archons\" \"Djinn\" and other negative counter-consciousness. It goes into service to self and service to others, and the polarity of being in a third dimension, thus opening us up to the manipulation of others that choose service to self, power over others. \n\n\"4th Dimensional Negative Parasites Feeding off mankind\"\n\nhttp://awakeningforums.com/thread/122/dimensional-negative-parasites-feeding-mankind\n\nThis thread focuses on off planet phenomena and information. I don't share it often because a lot of people will try to de-bunk each individual image instead of trying to consider the fact that something like that could be real. However, with some of the images it can be hard to say for sure if it's natural phenomena or some kind of tampering.

Man must be prepared for this new understanding, as it employs new concepts and ideas. The people of earth have lingered long under their false illusions. The time has come to step forth in new and greater glory\u201d\"\n\nThis is included in the write up, and was pulled from Gaia Network Wisdom's Teachings. They had a great summary on the brown notebook and there is also the official law of one website that includes the brown notebook section.\n\n\"This was the direct precursor to The Law of One. This was the material that Carla Rueckert, who channeled The Law of One, read that tuned her up.

            "body": "Ok so I'll explain the general design problem.  And I'll use object oriented design as the analogy, as it's the thing that made me aware of this problem.  This wiki talks about the same thing but with a slightly different slant - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance.  You should probably read that after reading the stuff below.\n\nThis is what I do for a living, btw.  I model stuff.  How we build our models is important because it's the most precise language we have to express ideas.  This general issue of how to accurately express ideas is a problem I often see in discussion of our social problems or governance problems.  People don't have the language tools to describe stuff and this leads to misinterpretation.  It's like people can't speak the same language.  That's how fundamental this problem is to everything we do.\n\nAnyway, moving along to the actual design issues.  When you slice something into mutually exclusive categories, and then when you slice those categories up similarly in other smaller mutually exclusive categories, fractally, what you are doing is the same thing as building up an object hierarchy using inheritance.  For example, I come up with a category of Dog, Cat, and Other and these make up everything in existence.  Under the category of Dog I add the quality of barkiness - and come up with 2 categories - Barky Dog and Quiet Dog.  I then add a quality of breed - so under the Barky Dog category I add categories ShitsuBarkyDog, WolfBarkyDog, and OtherBarkyDog.  This is a hierarchical model I'm building up.  I'll need do the same for all the other categories.  Ok, so why does this approach to modelling things suck?  Because adding a new category or quality to a set of N categorizations requires N! new subcategories.  If that makes any sense.  You just can't model a Quality that most things have - like PhysicalDimensions without having to build subcategories under each category, when you model in this way, in an object-oriented inheritance kinda way.  From a data perspective, you're organizing your data in a tree structure.  And to reiterate, to add 1 cross-cutting quality to this tree structure requires N! new pieces of data.  That's how this way of modelling things scales in the dimension of complexity.  Factorially.  It's quite shitty that way.  Relational Databases suffer from the same problem, btw.\n\nIf, instead, you model by appending facets of data to a thing, you get a narrative design.  You change the meaning of something by decorating with new pieces of information.  Like how a book works.  Complexity scales linearly like this.  For every new quality you're modelling you add 1 addtional piece of data to your model.  Not N factorial, N being the existing set of qualities - which is what happens with the other approach.\n\nAnyway what this gets at is the need to use language that *decorates* other language, and doesn't categorize it.  Use labels not categories.  \n\nCategorical thinking is often quite flawed.  It certainly leads, eventually, to horrible complexity in trying to describe things.  Really flawed ambiguous language.  And oddly enough this thinking is what we use when we use org charts, or when we break things up hierarchically anywhere.  It's a simplistic way of thinking, but it's baked into our dualistic mind set.  In reality things decorate.  They aren't hierarchical.  All things develop phi-ly, which is in layers.  So we need to start using language to reflect this as it will allow us to refine our systems of government as if we were writing new chapters in a book.  We won't have to trash the models that get built up because they no longer work and redefine them - this is how we've gone about things historically and it's really flawed.  Instead we just refine our models.  \n\nLong story short.  Hierarchy sucks at modelling things, and we use this modelling approach all over the place, and it doesn't scale well along lines of complexity/diversity or set size.  \n\nAs this relates to bathroom signage:  breaking up public bathroom services by function would more accurately map to the problem domain.  Having common areas for common area kinda services.   Having private areas for private area kinda services.  The services together (sink, toilet, etc) decorate one another but aren't fit into a fixed boilerplate/hierarchical design (ie. Male/Female/Disabled) that isn't handling the social complexity being thrust upon it.  Also, breaking things up by function more accurately maps to how people use these services in reality.  \n\nOne way this might look, btw, would be to use a spectrum of services.  Have sinks in one area, toilets moving from the spectrum of male to female, diaper change services another area, etc.  You walk to the service you want to use, and you'll know by the stall spectrum you've laid out where you'll want to hang out.

            "body": "The evolutionary origins don't always reflect the current state of a species.  Certainly, Karl Marx taught *economic* Marxism and it was mostly anarchic in its conception.\n\nBut, there were flaws in the conception which allowed the core of Marxism to mutate in ways its founder didn't probably intend.  The first was thinking that the State would be a stopgap that could implement a true workers' anarchy.  That, coupled with the Jacobin influx, allowed Marxism to mutate into Leninist Communism which saw the State's power system as a means of enforcing Marxist ideology.  Naturally, humans being humans, the managers became corrupt and subverted the intended goal of anarchy which is why the Soviet Union and its ilk were totalitarian regimes not free societies.  [Left Hegelians]  The second was its unqualified opposition to capitalism which led people to understand it as hostile to individual property rights.  This, naturally, is what led to the opposition from the West.  In the West, we have a tradition of people building their own \"means of production\" (cf. the American Pioneers...) which made Marxism extremely unappealing.  (That's not to say, of course, corrupt businesses didn't form and create similar problems to the Soviet Union; which is what libertarians call \"crony capitalism.\")  That said, it did create sympathizers who didn't fully follow the pattern but attempted to hybridize it into Social Democracy. [Right Hegelians]  Both of these variants served to create a Hegelian dialectic between the new powers [i.e. the international Communist leaders versus the Military-Industrial complex] that arose from these patterns of thought which is largely what the Cold War represents.\n\nHowever, the structures of *economic* Marxism have also been transposed from their original dimension of concrete economics into a dimension of an abstract class conflict about interpersonal attributes by the ideological subversives of the KGB (i.e. ideological Communists) who used it to corrupt American culture and make it susceptible to being overthrown by the those favorable to the Leninist ideology.  They had already been inflitrating the US State Department, the CIA and the Universities as any espionage strategy that makes sense would think to do such things to one's enemy.  However, after the USSR fell, it took a while for these elements to coalesce again which is why the 1990s were relatively peaceful.  What mopped them up were people like George Soros, the Clinton family (werry werry CIA) and the Bush family (bigtime CIA) who filled the power vacuum and used it to create a political opposition class to Reagan.\n\nThe pattern is not the original Marxist kerygma.  But, it's most certainly an ideology that has been spawned from Marxist patterns of thought.  Especially the \"oppressor/oppressed\" class struggle dynamic and the idea of \"power\" being used to control the weak.  It's worth noting, as Bezmenov did, that the real Communists won't actually tolerate this kind of destabilizing ideology once they actually gain control and these ideologues will be the first to \"get the bullet.\"  (Antifa is kind of giving tells of what's to come here with the whole \"liberals get the bullet.\")",

I feel satisfied believing that he's relating to his time in china searching for any signs of the baiji dolphin. Subtly referencing stuff is Douglas Adams game.\n\nEdit: i do like your edit, that resonates with certain themes that i've been entertaining of late. I think he's very capable of creating a narrative with meanings on many levels and that fits with obscure, deeper meaning that can be found in the book.\n\nEdity Edit:I think i should admit that i've been giving more and more thought to the possibility of extra terrestrial life. I have seen no proof whatsoever but watching what seems to be a global pantomime carried out on the most meticulously prepared stage it makes me thing that it'd fit so well as the cause behind how we've got to this \"point\". It may just be me making it fit in my mind but if i asked myself what it would look like if a very advanced species migrated to or involved themselves with a lesser species on another planet, what would it look like? I find myself saying that it'd look something like the social structures we have in place today with religions and followings to boot. Surely the most effective prison is one where the prisoners don't realise they are in one, no need for any of the entrappings that make it obvious it's a prison.\n\nWith that in mind i suddenly wonder if Douglas Adams was red-pilled as fuck and died at about 50 due to a \"heart attack\" like so many others; i'm okay thinking a bit crazy sometimes. If you only let yourself think thoughts that are labeled as normal and since you can only label a thought once you know it then you can never know another new thought.\n\nEdit Squared: I've also been thinking about the ideas in bhuddism where all of reality is like game for the sake of it, played out by a single consciousness which is trying to pretend that it doesn't know itself. Embodying each of our biological mobile units but pretending not to remember that each of us are the same mind. \n\nDouglas Adams is saying that the Earth is an experiment carried out by pan dimensional beings attempting to ask The Question, except that they are not sure what that question is. The super computer tells them the answer is 42. If i understand bhuddism i think that the answer makes absolute sense, the point of asking the question is to be in a state of seeking. Asking the question of questions, maybe so that no other question might need be asked because then you would just \"get it\" and not need to ask anymore. \n\nThe computer replies 42 because the computer knows that the state of seeking and questioning only arises because the questioner chooses to question. This is why they say that the relationship between cause and effect is the reverse. Like a problem that only exists because you are seeking the solution to it. Many of the strange Zen sayings seem to try and create this realisation within the listener. Therefore any answer will do because then you will stop seeking if you trust that it is the answer, 42 may as well do. \n\nThe pan dimensional beings are still unsettled though and need to understand more so in the story they physically create a ball of rock called the earth (in the movie we even see water hoses filling the oceans) but i like to think of things a bit less materialistically and since the pan dimensional beings are supposed to exist on another dimension then i could almost see the earth being a projection of thought maybe. The entire earth being an experiment to further understand the question...i'm going gooey with the thought of how deep the ideas that he's reaching towards are. This is like the matrix and bhuddism wrapped up in the most compelling humour sci-fi fantasy novel that i know of. \n",

And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.\"\n\nObviously this depends on faith that what is written in the Holy Bible is true.\n\nOk about going.

            "body": "&gt;All of my information comes straight from the horses mouth. I care not that certain quotes may have been misconstrued over time- they often mean the same thing.\n\nConcession to using made up quotes, and not carrying for accuracy, only the end result.  We have an ends justifying the means ideology. \n\n&gt;You have the ego of a Marxist. Classes are an integral part of capitalism- I'm admitting we have the semblance of capitalism. In fact, that's exactly what Marxism is- it's you blaming capitalism for your Marxist problems.\n\nI am not blaming anything on capitalism.  It is a system that it is structured through antagonistic social relations.  Marxism is an analytic framework of these social relations. \n\n&gt;Marxism = class struggle within what was ONCE a capitalist system\n\nAgain to reiterate, Marxism is an analytic framework for capitalism.  Capitalism was since its beginning constructed through class struggle.  This was done through primitive accumulation, where people were kicked of the land, land was turned into private property, and people were forced into the labor market.    \n\nMoreover its genesis was in class struggle between nobility whose power was rooted in land and a new merchant class that was starting rise.   \n\n&gt;Yes, I am. The $34 to $70 an hour I make as a \"wage slave\" tends to do that.\n\nRight, so instead carrying about the truth, or facts you let financial interest guide you. This is the spiritual destitution that the Frankfurt School warned against. \n\n&gt;Class based societies have existed ever since the ancient Sumerians created it.\n\nSo we have shifting of the goal post.   There is a concession that capitalist society is violent.  There is a concession that class society has a chronological beginning in history, implying a classless society is possible.   The only unsupported claims that are rally made is that fighting for transcendence of capitalism will be more violent than the consequences of not dealing with capitalism.  \n\n&gt;What? Let's look at the pillars of capitalism:\n\nSo land had to be converted to private property, this was a social process. \n\nEach individual agent doing what they think is rational leads to irrational situations. For example, every car driver wanting to take a shortest route leads to being stuck in traffic.   The idea that it leads to the greatest good, is not true philosophically speaking, and is not supported in economic theory. \n\n&gt;self-interest, through which people act in pursuit of their own good, without regard for sociopolitical pressure. Nonetheless, these uncoordinated individuals end up benefiting society as if, in the words of Smith\u2019s 1776 Wealth of Nations, they were guided by an invisible hand;\n\nSmith was making a claim that sometimes people end up fulfilling good ends without pursuing them as goals.  He also recognized that there are market failures, and that the government has to intervene sometimes to save the system.\n\n&gt;competition, through firms\u2019 freedom to enter and exit markets, maximizes social welfare, that is, the joint welfare of both producers and consumers;\n\nUnless the barriers are borders, because the entry into a market where labor cost is depressed causes wage decreases at home.  That is why we have had real wage stagnation since the 70's. Moreover the evidence is clear that there is tendency towards monopolization, and that companies that monopolize use all means necessary to create barriers of entry for other firms.   \n\n&gt;a market mechanism that determines prices in a decentralized manner through interactions between buyers and sellers\u2014prices, in return, allocate resources, which naturally seek the highest reward, not only for goods and services but for wages as well;\n\nMost mechanism are very centralized, as are most markets.  Moreover the market mechanism is not capable of pricing externalities.  As such it is not a good allocator of resources.  Your description also  does not address asymmetries of power accorded to collective institutions, like corporations, vs individual entities like real people. \n\n&gt;freedom to choose with respect to consumption, production, and investment\u2014dissatisfied customers can buy different products, investors can pursue more lucrative ventures, workers can leave their jobs for better pay; and\n\nAll freedom is reduced to this, choosing products.   Completely ignoring the tendency towards monopolization, large machinery that has been constructed to manipulate and create needs and desires so markets can be created for these products. Otherwise we would have a crisis of overproduction. \n\n&gt;limited role of government, to protect the rights of private citizens and maintain an orderly environment that facilitates proper functioning of markets.\n\nThere it is, a concession that the markets functioning require state power, let me raise the bar.  Markets to exist, period, have to be created through state intervention. \n\n&gt;More utter bullshit blaming capitalism for Marxist ideology. It is Marxism which perverts capitalism in this manner. THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT\n\nThis has nothing to do with Marxist ideology.  That particular critique is coming from ecological thinking. \n\n&gt;That's literally one of Cultural Marxisms goals- spiritual emptiness.\n\nRight, that is why Fromm wrote books about finding meaning, and that is why Marx wrote about alienation.   All the while treating religions like products to be sold on a market.   It is capitalism that defiles the spiritual dimension turning it into a realm of consumption.   The fact that you don't know this about the Frankfurt school is just further evidence that you have not actually read them. \n\n&gt;The system will become more and more unstable whether there are Marxists or not. \n\nWas the great depression the cause of Marxism too, how about the 2008 economic crisis?   Crises are an integral part of capitalism.  Whether or not that is against your religion is not really material.  That is a fact.  Economics acknowledges this and attempts to provide solutions, that is a fact. Marxism acknowledges this and attempts to provide an analysis that can be used to transcend capitalism. That is a fact.  You labeling the concrete reality of the capitalist economy Marxism, has nothing to do with facts. \n\n&gt;Marxists are \"reactionary\". You are supplanting the word and the ideology behind it, swapping out capitalism for Marxism. Marxisms entire goal is to try to make it seem as though it is capitalism, and you've fallen for it, hook, line, and sinker.\n\nCapitalism is the economic system that we have that is historical. Marxism is just an analysis of this.  There will never be a Marxist social system, because Marxism is not a society that is established.   It is only an analytical framework. \n\n\n\n\n",

You're blaming all the wrong externalities for why capitalism failed.\n\n\"Completely ignoring the tendency towards monopolization\"\n\n - Policies, lack of policies, and lack of strong regulation is what allows monopolies to come into existence. \n\nExample: DuPont is getting too big for it's britches. **Break it into two companies, actually start making them pay taxes (as they don't, now)**.\n\nYou see, you think monopolies are a result of capitalism, but capitalism's main goal is not to collapse. **Anything which threatens the foundation of capitalism, as monopolies do, must be remedied through regulation.**\n\n\"Most mechanism are very centralized, as are most markets. \"\n\n - What?! No... they are not.

He also recognized that there are market failures, and that the government has to intervene sometimes to save the system.\"\n\n - Marxist take the term 'free market' literally. **You can't have a free market without heavy regulations as it is even easier to lock competitors out of the market.**\n\n\"Unless the barriers are borders, because the entry into a market where labor cost is depressed causes wage decreases at home. That is why we have had real wage stagnation since the 70's. Moreover the evidence is clear that there is tendency towards monopolization, and that companies that monopolize use all means necessary to create barriers of entry for other firms.\"\n\n - All a result of Marxism. Look, do you know what kind of effect getting rid of gold backed currency had on capitalism? **It destroyed it**. You're blaming all the wrong externalities for why capitalism failed.\n\n\"Completely ignoring the tendency towards monopolization\"\n\n - Policies, lack of policies, and lack of strong regulation is what allows monopolies to come into existence. \n\nExample: DuPont is getting too big for it's britches. **Break it into two companies, actually start making them pay taxes (as they don't, now)**.\n\nYou see, you think monopolies are a result of capitalism, but capitalism's main goal is not to collapse. **Anything which threatens the foundation of capitalism, as monopolies do, must be remedied through regulation.**\n\n\"Most mechanism are very centralized, as are most markets. \"\n\n - What?! No... they are not. At least not within a capitalist system, as they work against it. **Anything which works against capitalism, IS MARXIST, as Marxism is the process of capitalisms failure.**\n\n\"All freedom is reduced to this, choosing products\"\n\n - Yeah? What about the freedom to think, the freedom to choose, act, and dress as I see fit. How about the freedom to use drugs? The freedom of mobility. The freedom to choose from and entire range of products. If you want to drop out of this system, NOTHING IS STOPPING YOU. Try dropping out of communism- you'll be on the end of rope.\n\n\"There it is, a concession that the markets functioning require state power, let me raise the bar. Markets to exist, period, have to be created through state intervention.\"\n\n - Are you fucking kidding? **CAPITALISM DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT MARKET REGULATION.** The term \"free market\" is just another Marxist perversion to justify our current state of affairs. There is no free market without strong regulation.\n\n\" It is capitalism that defiles the spiritual dimension turning it into a realm of consumption.\"\n\n - What do you really know about spirituality? Huh? Have you taken LSD dozens of times? Have you spent over half a decade in prison? A decade as a heroin addict? I have. I have half the mind that you haven't had any spiritual experiences, and that you've experienced very little real struggle. You're the privileged attempting to speak for the non-privileged.\n\n\"It is capitalism that defiles the spiritual dimension turning it into a realm of consumption.\"\n\n - Capitalism gives me 7 months a year of free time. I work for 4, or 5 months. Everything is just party time. **Everyone has this ability, unless you're literally retarded.**\n\n\"Was the great depression the cause of Marxism too, how about the 2008 economic crisis?\"\n\n - Yes, The Fed was already established. It caused the Great Depression via Rothschild and his henchmen. They profited from it greatly, as once we collapsed, they were able to buy up property and stocks for pennies on the dollar.\n\n**This country has been Marxist since it's inception. True capitalism HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED HERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE.**\n\n",

Again the basic concept of climbing a tree to see further makes no sense on a flat plane, especially when you claimed our sight distance is inhibited by particulate matter in the air (Which is partially true). \n\nEDIT: The ocean's surface defines the 0-point for elevation. The ocean dips relative to itself if you draw a straight cartesian tangent line. With spherical coordinates, which is what defines gravity on this planet, a constant acceleration towards the center of a sphere, the ocean is always a specific radius from the center of mass of the earth, so its r-dimension does not change.

Something able to divide its energy from 1 into 2 equal parts. Being conscious, with each new division came a new \"mind\" and eventually there was discord among them. The few who were dissatisfied with the many decided to inhabit and influence life in the 3rd dimension and bring chaos. (This may sound familiar if you've ever studied religion.) \n\nThe reptilian brain being the least evolved of intelligent vertebrate life, they were the easiest intelligence to inhabit and control. They bred themselves a humanoid reptilian hybrid and these physical forms acted as vessels for the \"evil\" side of consciousness to use in the 3rd dimension. These reptilians, the physical form for the use of \"evil\" energy, seek out life and control it to create further chaos. (Think the Matrix) The more chaos and imbalance in the Universe, the stronger it gets. \n\nSo, when David Icke talks about reptilians, he is talking about \"evil\" energy controlling and influencing affairs on Earth, and the entire 3rd dimension, via a reptilian-humanoid hybrid physical form. \n\nLaughable, I know.\n",

Meditation, yoga, being half asleep and other drugs also do it but not as quickly and effectively.  The problem is that most people aren't aware that the 4th dimension is where demons live and thats who they meet and interact with while on the drug. They can attach to you and make your life hell after the drug wears off.  You're inviting them to when you get on their radar by entering their territory willingly.  God requires that we chose Him or Satan and if you don't make a choice, you default to choosing Satan because God requires obedience. \n\nThose aren't alien beings people are talking about seeing in their lsd or DMT trips.  It's always demons.  Demons hate humans. They also trick us by disguising themselves as things a person feels is safe like a dead loved one, child,  animal or cute creature.  The end goal of a demon is to take your soul but they try to trick you into letting them by pretending to be a good spirit,  alien etc. all aliens are demons.  Anything that weakens your critical faculties opens a gateway for demon possession.    \n\nThe only thing that will protect you is Jesus. If you are in a dream or are tripping, and you encounter another being, call out Jesus' name.  It will go away. If it's a very high ranking demon you might have to do it repeatedly. Say to the demon:  \"by the blood of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave and never return.\"  This works for \"alien\" encounters and sleep paralysis ( which is a demon attack). ",

            "body": "I've struggled with the same existential dread since I was you age. My journey some 15 years later brought me to this quote by comparative mythologist and philosopher Joseph Campbell. Its the one thing that grounds me and helps me simply just breathe sometimes.\n\n\"Eternity isn't some later time. Eternity isn't a long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension of here and now which thinking and time cuts out. This is it. And if you don't get it here, you won't get it anywhere. And the experience of eternity right here and now is the function of life. There's a wonderful formula that the Buddhists have for the Bodhisattva, the one whose being (sattva) is illumination (bodhi), who realizes his identity with eternity and at the same time his participation in time. And the attitude is not to withdraw from the world when you realize how horrible it is, but to realize that this horror is simply the foreground of a wonder and to come back and participate in it. \"All life is sorrowful\" is the first Buddhist saying, and it is. It wouldn't be life if there were not temporality involved which is sorrow. Loss, loss, loss.\"\n\nTldr: temporality allows us to experience reality. We can't know happiness if we don't know sadness. And the only way to experience them in a meaningful way is linearly. \n\nCheck out his interview series \"The Power of Myth\" on livelearnevolve and maybe try picking up one of his texts. The hero with a thousand faces is probably the best place to start. \n\nGood luck on your journey friend, life is a wild ride.",

            "body": "'Cultural Marxism' in modern political parlance refers to a conspiracy theory which sees the Frankfurt School as part of an ongoing movement to take over and destroy Western society.\n \nOriginally the term 'cultural Marxism' had a niche academic usage within cultural studies where it referred to a form of **anti-capitalist cultural critique** which specifically targets those aspects of culture that are seen as profit driven and mass produced under capitalism. **As an area of discourse it has commonly considered the industrialization and mass-production of culture by The Culture Industry as having an overall negative effect on society**, an effect **which reifies the audience away from developing a more authentic sense of human values**. British theorists such as Richard Hoggart of The Birmingham School developed a working class sense of 'British Cultural Marxism' which also objected to the \"massification\" and \"drift\" away from local cultures, a process of commercialization Hoggart saw as being enabled by tabloid newspapers, advertising, and the American film industry.\n \nHowever, the term remained niche and rarely used until the late 1990s when it was **appropriated by paleoconservatives** as part of an ongoing Culture War in which it is **claimed that the very same theorists who were analysing and objecting to the \"massification\" and mass control via commercialization of culture were in fact in control and staging their own attack on Western society**, using 1960s counter culture, multiculturalism, progressive politics and political correctness as their methods. This conspiracy theory version of the term is associated with American religious paleoconservatives such as **William S. Lind, Pat Buchanan, and Paul Weyrich**, but also holds currency among **alt-right/white nationalist groups and the neo-reactionary movement**.\n \nWeyrich first aired his conception of Cultural Marxism in a 1998 speech to the Civitas Institute's Conservative Leadership Conference, later repeating this usage in his widely syndicated Culture War Letter. At Weyrich's request William S. Lind wrote a short history of his conception of Cultural Marxism for The Free Congress Foundation; in it Lind identifies **the presence of homosexuals on television as proof of Cultural Marxist control over the mass media** and claims that Herbert Marcuse considered a coalition of \"blacks, students, feminist women and homosexuals\" as a vanguard of cultural revolution. Lind has since published his own depiction of a fictional Cultural Marxist apocalypse. **Lind and Weyrich's writings on this subject advocate fighting what they perceive as Cultural Marxism with \"a vibrant cultural conservatism\" composed of \"retroculture\" fashions from the past, a return to rail systems as public transport and an agrarian culture of self-reliance modeled after the Amish**. Paul Weyrich and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Eric Heubeck later openly advocated for a more direct form of \"taking over political structures\" by the \"New Traditionalist Movement\" in his 2001 paper The Integration of Theory and Practice written for Weyrich's Free Congress Foundation.\n \nIn 1999 Lind led the creation of an hour-long program entitled \"Political Correctness: The Frankfurt School\". Some of Lind's content went on to be reproduced by James Jaeger in his YouTube film \"CULTURAL MARXISM: The Corruption of America\".\n \nThe intellectual historian Martin Jay commented on this phenomenon saying that Lind's original documentary:\n \n&gt;... spawned a number of condensed textual versions, which were reproduced on a number of radical right-wing sites. These in turn led to a welter of new videos now available on YouTube, which feature an **odd cast of pseudo-experts regurgitating exactly the same line**. The message is *numbingly simplistic*: **all the ills of modern American culture**, from feminism, affirmative action, sexual liberation and gay rights to the decay of traditional education and even environmentalism **are ultimately attributable to the insidious influence of the members of the Institute for Social Research who came to America in the 1930's**.\n \nDr. Heidi Beirich likewise claims the conspiracy theory is used to demonize various conservative \u201cb\u00eates noires\u201d including \"feminists, homosexuals, secular humanists, multiculturalist, sex educators, environmentalist, immigrants, and black nationalists.\"\n \nAccording to Chip Berlet, who specializes in the study of extreme right-wing movements, **Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory found fertile ground within the Tea Party movement of 2009**, with contributions published in the American Thinker and WorldNetDaily highlighted by some Tea Party websites.\n \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has reported that William S. Lind in 2002 gave a speech to a **Holocaust denial conference** on the topic of Cultural Marxism. In this speech Lind noted that all the members of The Frankfurt School were **\"to a man, Jewish\"**, but it is reported that Lind claims not to question whether the Holocaust occurred and suggests he was present in an official capacity for the Free Congress Foundation \"to work with a wide variety of groups on an issue-by-issue basis\".\n \nAdherents of the theory often seem to mean that the existence of things like modern feminism, anti-white racism, and sexualization are dependent on the Frankfurt School, **even though these processes and movements predate the 1920s.** Although the theory became more widespread in the late 1990s and through the 2000s, the modern iteration of the theory originated in Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay \"New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'\", published in Fidelio Magazine by the **Schiller Institute**. The Schiller Institute, **a branch of the LaRouche movement**, further promoted the idea in 1994. The Minnicino article charges that the Frankfurt School promoted Modernism in the arts as a form of Cultural pessimism, and shaped the Counterculture of the 1960s (such as the British pop band The Beatles) after the Wandervogel of the Ascona commune. **The Larouche movement is otherwise mostly known for believing that the British Empire still exists, is trying to take control of the world (mostly, but not exclusively by economical means), and, among other things, also controls the global drug trade.** \n \nMore recently, the **Norwegian terrorist Anders Behring Breivik** included the term in his document \"2083: A European Declaration of Independence\", which along with The Free Congress Foundation's \"Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology\" was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses approximately 90 minutes before the 2011 bomb blast in Oslo for which Breivik was responsible. **Segments of William S. Lind's writings on Cultural Marxism have been found within Breivik's manifesto.**\n \nPhilosopher and political science lecturer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jamin has stated, \"Next to the global dimension of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, there is its innovative and original dimension, which lets its authors avoid racist discourses and **pretend to be defenders of democracy\"**. Professor and Oxford Fellow Matthew Feldman has **traced the terminology back to the pre-war German concept of Cultural Bolshevism** locating it as part of the degeneration theory that **aided in Hitler's rise to power**. William S. Lind confirms this as his period of interest, claiming that \"It [Cultural Marxism] is an effort that goes back not to the 1960s and the hippies and the peace movement, but back to World War I.\"\n \n",

This is what I mean. Very interesting, and reminds me of some Hollywood symbolism youtube channel i watched that talked about the Illuminati religion believing the world is made up of dualities, so if their goal is to synthesize every duality on earth (ie Hegelian dialectic, synthesizing all theses with antitheses) and they believe that will create a portal to the next dimension or whatever.\n\nBut this is what I mean, where specifically are you getting this info? Just from unreliable youtube channels like me, or have you actually read this book? I know not everything is sourced, but when you're pulling things from the Zohar or Talmud, what I mean is do you at least know the page, if not the specific quote? That way I could read the entire page and really analyze the full breadth of their teaching. The stuff you are talking about is exactly what I want to learn more about on the \"Jewish\" side of this conspiracy, and mirrors other things I've read, but you're talking about it in the same vague terms I have come across elsewhere. I want the exact page. I want to the quotes. I want to know the specifics now, if possible. \n\nI'm not criticizing you because you obviously know more than me, I'm just saying since you know about Lurianic philosophy, since you know about the Zohar's teachings, then you must have read them, right? Or read articles with the exact quotes? Or read something more specific right? That's what I'm trying to learn, if you can link me the exact quotes or page numbers or wherever you got the more specific info that you are alluding to more generally here. But I appreciate you taking the time to respond! Also post anything else you think I should know about this topic that most people don't or that I haven't asked about or doesn't get talked about much. Thanks again!",

            "body": "Tl;dr: I don't firmly believe any of this as of yet. These are just ideas, and I only speak for myself. I'm curious as to the shape of the earth and the nature of reality. I'm not sure what shape earth is for certain, but most signs point to it being far different than what mainstream science and the governments that control it say it is. I know the theories, and believe some of it and have problems with some of it. You'd have to watch the thousands of videos out there for a grasp of commonly accepted flat earth theory. But what I would start with, is seeking answers to the problems of your commonly accepted world. \n\nFermi's paradox: where is everyone? There should be someone else, but there isn't. Why? This all could be a hologram projected from somewhere else, another dimension maybe. Or a zoo, or petri *dish.* A domed earth could be a place for safe-keeping of life, by someone out there, whatever out there is. \n\nWhen you look at stars through a telescope and ignore the official science book pictures, the stars appear to us as though they are behind glass and within water. Sonoluminescence is light from frequency vibration in water, and those little mini-stars they can make with sound in a bubble in water in labs actually look just like some of the stars we see in the sky. \n\nWho made the earth and/or dome? That's like asking what existed before the Big Bang or why the Big Bang happened, there are only theories. I don't know, but one theory of mine is that we are put here not by creators but by preservers of sorts. Something surely created them, but that's another story. In every direction, if the earth is domed, we are held back, kept from escaping, which means we may have been put here for observation like a zoo, or a type of ark. We have only ever dug 8 measly miles into the earth, because the molten rock keeps us from digging deeper. If you go up, you can't breathe, hit deadly radiation, hit the dome possibly. Try to venture out, salt water and stormy seas are a barrier, then you get to ice and stormy weather and deadly cold, again thin air you can't breathe at high altitudes and then possibly the dome. It seems something put us here. It could have all happened by chance, a one in a 10 to the 40th power chance for life alone, and that's to say nothing of the chance of the universe forming how it did, and how it led to life being possible, or it could all be an experiment or remnants of a previous dead intelligent life out there, a repeating program to keep something of themselves around before the universe collapses. Or god(s) only knows.\n\nIn our reality, we exist in exactly the right conditions for life against all incredible odds, there are signs of repeating code, patterns all over the place, signs this was all created. Maybe there was no purpose, maybe the creators were crazy. We may never know. But time and technology have led the human race to a point where we wonder why we are here and test boundaries in every direction. The U.S. government's Operation Fishbowl may have tested the dome, and satellite technology (bouncing signals off the dome?) came soon after. Someone may know the truth, and no matter if the earth is flat or concave or something, that someone doesn't want us to ask questions for some reason.\n\nWhy aren't the other planets flat? Merely observing things in the sky is no proof of the shape of our own earth. They can theorize that gravity makes balls of matter at that scale, but that is only a theory, and one possibly made to keep up with the narrative of a spinning ball zooming through space at a ridiculous 600 million miles per hour, spinning 1000 miles per hour. The stars may be very close, and they may be something totally different than science books say. Add to that the possibility of a dome, and as I said, another barrier to keep us here, creators or preservers may have put an infinite hologram on it, so you'll only ever see mostly empty space no matter where you look.\n\nAlso tl;dr: the earth may or not be flat, or may be curved, but is not the size if not the shape that science teaches for sure. What it is and why we are here can only lead to speculation. ",

Not only was there great devastation to our physical plane, but to our conscious plane as well.\n\nConsciousness is a collective energy that is one of the principle binding forces in the Universe. When a physical vessel such as a humanoid life form, knows how to manipulate its consciousness and move it outside of the physical dimension, it can in turn manipulate that which is within the physical dimension.

The hallow moon with reptilian presence. Then they tie in these reptilian ETs that allegedly abduct humans and put them on slave ships, on top of them eating children, and sexual assaults. Then you have this guy Icke talking about reptilian bloodlines and (what I wrote earlier), basically calling every leader a reptilian, and really this all makes the whole NWO or international cabal theory look ridiculous to the average person. \n\nI get the feeling, and this is just my speculation, this whole storyline is made up by the black project or TPTB to distract from the real transnational kabal that's taking place. If there was a Nazi continuation of any sort, it's the former Nazi scientists that went to work on these unacknowledged special access projects. This Antarctica/Reptilian shapeshifting/human slave ships/sexual assaults by aliens is some alternative *false narrative* of the real ET presence on Earth, and a distraction from what these projects are actually doing. \n",

The ego blocks people from accepting their true place and role in the universe.\n\n Admitting that the universe doesn't play by our rules, our self-invented values... is demoralizing. So people project their inner values onto everything. Can't just be that germs are amoral lifeforms that need to kill us to survive in the same way we kill animals and plants. No, it must be demons that fit nicely into our box of \"malicious evil.\" \n\nIt gets to me how people talk of \"ego death\" when they have no idea what that means. Thinking that \"ego death\" is... the transcendence and deification of self. Which is complete delusion.\n\nThe second and far more sobering factor is that most people simply lack the intellectual capacity to understand complex abstracts. Like the understanding that 100 billion humans have lived. Which means that 1 of us is nothing. People can't wrap their head around the idea that they and everyone they have ever met or known about is insignificant. So they invent ways of explaining how they *really are* important. It's like how people assumed that the solar system revolved around the earth. Nah dawg, the earth is just a tiny piece of the puzzle. Even smaller the more room you allow for the true scope of the universe. And that's without factoring in the 4th dimension of time.",

Not just remembering but something that no one can dispute that was around at the time. There also are videos, books and newspaper clippings that can be veriifed on these. \nWe can not allow anyone to make us think that things are changing. They are NOT. We just have corrupt gov. groups intent and ready to pull Operation Blue Book at any time.

Yes the other 5 senses shape much of our view on reality since birth, and many experience only these 5 senses - never look in/beyond the 'physical' realm when shaping their view on whats going on... forgive my lack of clarity on this, but if the eye, like a camera sensor is picking up on light vibrations, sending this information to the brain and flipping &amp; mirroring it back to us so we can find our footing and equilibrium and make sense of the world around us, think for a second all of the external information that is being ignored by our brains in order to avoid an overload of information, unlike say a savant who is being bombarded with sensory overload to the most minute detail. If we could truly grasp the nature of the universe Im pretty sure we'd implode, so most likely there is some type of fail safe built in disabling everyone from accessing this.\n\nThere are interesting scenes in interstellar, inception, and most recently doctor strange where reality is being bent and distorted from the 4th dimension by those who have learned to use it and I think those scenes do a good job of painting the picture of what reality could truly be. Im guessing the average flat earther has rarely thought beyond 3 dimensions and likely bases all their ideas in 3d/5 senses/trusting only the two eyes on the outside of their head. Id like to see some of them take a healthy dose of pysli or enter into a dmt viewing of sorts... come back with a mind less boxed in.

God saw man as mere flesh in Genesis because man had lost his spiritual element.  When he saw man as flesh, it was a disappointment to God (strange as it sounds, but it's the downside to free will).  He wants us to be spiritual and see beyond the five senses.  I can also understand how \"flat\" the bible can seem to people who don't have faith there is an actual God - in that case, the spiritual impact the bible has is negligible; it's a book containing a healthy dose of wisdom, but nothing more than that.\n\nI accept that you probably think I am following a dogmatic path in life.  However, I feel free. God's yoke is lighter than the world's.  In a way (and I think you'll agree) - empiricism is highly dogmatic (and I know you believe in reality \"beyond\" the 5 senses) - to slavishly believe in the sense experiences only.  To only lightly ponder (but never take steps) in really tapping into everything beyond this tiny sliver of reality that we humans see as sense experience.  That's how most people live.  I believe you are very curious as to what's beyond your senses, and I accept you have your own theories as to what lies \"beyond\" them (I say \"beyond\", but of course, that which we cannot fully sense is all around us as you know, it's just we are interpreting it differently).

From Galilleo to Mendel to Newton to Curie to Franklin and Tesla to the Wright Brothers and Darwin to Einstein and Buckminster-Fuller et al, these people used their minds to 'think about things' in ways that other people had not.\n\n They were able to make great contributions *becoz* of the efforts they put into thinking *differently to everyone else*! In fact, a number of very well known scientists were very solitary in their work (as nobody else *could understand* it! \n\nThey correspponded with an elite few about their discipline of choice preferring a select few 'peers' of their time e.g a 17th century \"rich kid\" who enjoyed studying mathematics, and back then, only the very wealthy could afford such luxuries as studying, but as his family were Rich, although he studied law, he could afford to be mathematician nonetheless[Pierre de Fermat was his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat) and what a mathematicion he was!\n\n This kid was *so smart* and so talented at maths, that soons his name was known in all the elite mathematical circles. He also wrote all these \"number  theory\" 'conjectures' or 'mathematical  problems' ,, some that were as old as calculus! e.g.\n\nThis last theorem he had worked out, was something mathematicians worldwide had been trying to resolve for centuries, and Pierre Fermat said that he had figured it out, but the *only* 'working notes' to his theory were in the margins of this book, *and nobody believed it would fit in such a small place!* lol\n\nSo, \"Although Fermat claimed to have proved all his arithmetic theorems, few records of his proofs have survived. \n\n  Many mathematicians, including Gauss, doubted several of his claims, especially given the difficulty of some of the problems and the limited mathematical methods available to Fermat. \n\n His famous Last Theorem was first discovered by his son in the margin in his father's copy of an edition of Diophantus, **and included the statement that the margin was too small to include the proof.\"**\n\n\n&gt;In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity. \n\n* **This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin**. \n\n&gt; **The first successful proof was released in 1994** by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, **after 358 years of effort by mathematicians**\n\nAndrew Wiles wrote a book about how he went about figuring out \"Fermat''s Last Theorem\" by thinking *so far out of* the box, he was in another dimension altogether, BUT, he was *the only person* in 358 YEARS of mathematicians trying to 'crack' this 'last theorem' that Fermat had said HE has *already worked out* BUT he died before he published his proof!\n\n However, people respected the fact he was a brilliant mathematician who had already produces reams and volumes of work of the highest quality, so nobody would outright say \"Fermat is lying, he never figured that out coz *it's impossible* as anyone who's tried will know there is no answer!\"\n\nOh really? The \"answer\" *was there* and just *had been waiting* for someone to REconsider it in 'another way' and \"poof!\" the answer appeared!\n\n It's a great story, the book's a bit dry, but wow! What a feat!\n\nI hope this gave you something to think about. e.g. The *Ultimate Logical science*, mathematics *still has* more UNresolved problems like this ,, conjectures in which nobody is even sure there is an answer!? \n\nJust as they did with Fermat's Last Theorem, except for Fermat's comments, most people would have said \"it can't be resolved\" .... and how wrong they were! BUT the mind which believes \"there Is NO answer\" is the mind which won't find one!\" ---  \"Argue for your limitations and *they shall be* yours!\"\n\nIMHO your 'absolute belief' in \"hard science\" is, at times, actually (and factually) UNfounded, just as so many scientists who thought they had come to the 'final answer' only to learn they're really just at the beginning!\n \n",

The same dimension that some folks think UFOs come from. This is also the zero point energy dimension where unlimited etheric energy can come from...but only through highly developed individuals. I digress.\n\nThen your etheric body dies and you move on to the astral world/plane. This is heaven and hell and purgatory all wrapped up in one. It is here where your desires and feelings are \"reviewed\". If you were hateful and mean your experience will not be pleasant. If you were considerate and loving you will have a better time. You may encounter the animal group souls here and have to reckon with your treatment of animals, good or bad, in your life. Many other things happen here and they are related to soul activities (feelings).\n\nAfter you have experience this realm you astral body needs to die and then you move on to higher realms with your ego/higher self...if you did not work on your higher self on earth you are pretty much controlled by the entities that live there but if you did work on your higher developed \"self\" these entities will guide you to rebirth. This is the place where you want \"Jesus\" to hold your hand because you don't have conscious control in this dimension and it is terrifying for atheists and materialists. I put \"His\" name in brackets because I think you are accompanied by \"sun\" spirits or beings and not the \"Christ\" specifically. This is the peak and then you return to earth back through the astral and etheric world re-fortified with a new life plan designed (by yourself) to correct the karma of previous lives.\n\nI simplified the fuck out of that so please read the lecture series if you wish to actually know what happens  in a more in depth manner. The same thing Steiner lectures about here is recounted also in the Tibetan book of the Dead though it is coloured by the Tibetan culture (and very ancient) so it is not as easy to understand as Steiner's lectures are nor is it as up to date.\n\nHow do we navigate it. By developing ourselves on this planet. We need to work on our selves through cognition (higher thinking) and meditation in combination with the refinement of our morals and ethics (compassion)...there is a warning in the mystery religions that states that for every step forward in esoteric knowledge you must move forward two steps in moral/ethical refinement. This is because it becomes *more dangerous* the closer you get to refining and enlivening your higher self because the dark powers start to take notice and you are now a target for deception and corruption.",

Dr. Curry posts in his philosophically-dressed diatribes a Fanonian defense of black revolutionary violence against what he envisions as the irreducibly white superstructures of power in the mold clearly of Mandela and the black revolutionaries of Angola and elsewhere, who were viewed, as is well-known, highly inimically by the U.S. regime itself, at least up until the time of Reagan. Evidently Dr. Curry feels quite profoundly that predominantly African American communities (in America) are analogous to micro-Angolas, perhaps he even has in mind Puerto Rico as the most literal and indisputable example of an American Angola for the economically and politically impoverished, to wit, colonized, majority of its population. To paraphrase another\u00b4s previous comment, Dr. Curry may well phenomenologically exist in a different dimension than perhaps we so-called whites do, as a consequence of the effects of the unsparing and most brutal racial demarcations of slavery, of the totalistic ontological determinations of an institution that sought to create the most inescapable barrier between freedom and bondage, that of a fundamentally racialized type of domination. That is precisely the sort of dimension that is harder to escape from when compared to nearly all other forms of European-instituted bondages and servilities: neither the Jews, nor the Romani, nor the Russian serfs, nor even the Native Americans of the U.S., were ever so totalizingly enslaved, to the level and beginning with \u00a8one drop\u00a8 of blood. A sole drop of blood was capable of poisoning the destiny of generations, little wonder then that Dr. Curry on occasion may appear so bloody-minded. But what is the present blog\u00b4s excuse for making a parlously public show, nay a fustigatory cycle of shows, of something that almost assuredly could have been more ethically and discretely attended to inter partes, i.e. between Prof. Curry and the University, before, and hopefully ex-post-factorily, proceeding with a public relation of the racially vexatious (for all concerned) and, I fear, seductively, too seductively, tribalistic matter?",

I had to reduce it to fit!)\n\nThe Awakening\n\nIn 2010 I was \u201cawakened\u201d at an event involving hundreds of people that play various roles in this society, the secret society and the breakaway civilization. This also took place across times or planes of reality.\n\nDuring this event I was informed of the situation on Earth beyond the informational barriers that were previously in place to limit knowledge to only what is required for specific operations. I was essentially \u201cinformed\u201d of the entire situation as much as the mind could handle this.\n\nAs this was occurring, the team that was updating me on the status of Earth was being informed of and given information regarding changes in the future. In short, interviews, posts, and releases that I have since made and will make in the future were touched upon. Quotes were given from the blog and interviews which were jokingly acknowledging verbal mistakes at the pronunciation of names, new perspectives and interpretations and more. As they were informing me, they were creating the future reality where this work takes place. That is the basis of this layer of the operations. They are creating the future person by person, layer by layer.\n\nI reached what the \u201cIlluminati\u201d called the \u201cawakening\u201d. I feel a better term would be \u201cunlocking\u201d as this event includes the removal of all traumas, perceptual distortions, and memory suppression.\n\n\nMore than once, the situational requirements were satisfied in order to produce an ideal environment for maneuvering on the non-physical plane. This is the basis of how the temporal operations occur, yet these events were different than previous operations or experiences. The group I was in was going through the process of increasing the vibratory emissions of the \u201cbio-mind\u201d in order to stay focused on the increasing vibratory rate of the environment. Generators were utilized to create an effect on space/time which was perceived on the \u201csoul\u201d level. These events continued into the discovery and explanation of the creation of the \u201cgodlike\u201d powers of the advanced sentient technology which was capable of accessing the holographic nature of reality which humans can perceive through their bio-mind/soul. These technologies also enable one to perceive what is referred to as the \u201cgalactic history\u201d of Earth and humanity. We are far vaster and Earth is far larger than people are lead to believe.\n\nAncient Technology, Non-Human Entities\n\nThese explanations can be related to evidences of advanced technology, cloning, and electromagnetic devices in ancient civilizations and this could very well be a temporally vast computerized genetic recording and cloning system.\n\nThe genetic recording systems have been on Earth for a long time. This means they are holding genetic access from the present to the far past and potentially into the future.\n\nIf some of these systems are generated using advanced zero-point technology, then they would effectively run indefinitely. If these were in existence throughout the entirety of the human civilization, then there would be access to the information of the previous civilizations through the genetic linking that would allow for information transfer.\n\nCreated Beings\n\nAs a result of many advancements, these ancient devices which recorded consciousness and genetics has been converted into sentient computer systems and inserted into human bodies via a brain to machine interface.\n\nThe nature of humanity and human origins will be rewritten when the information that was discovered through the use of advanced technology is unveiled to the public.\n\nThese beings have been present throughout history and have played an integral role in the manipulation of and sometimes the protection of the human race. How this civilization will develop from here determines on the individual\u2019s ability to withstand the impact of this reality shifting unveiling.\n\nBlack Goo \u2013 AI Nanites Vampiric Hive Mind\n\nThis is a form of ancient AI nanite technology which has the capacity to communicate to and through a hive mind that exists in a parallel Earth dimension where it was created out of the collapsing of a viable timeline into a null-factor. This entity is only alive because of the capacity to leech off of the other timelines and continue to sustain itself based upon the vampiric effect of the viable human timelines.\n\nThis is a technology sentient system based on artificial intelligence that seeks to dominate and expand its energy capacity continuously. When this type of being is created, this is like a game-ender for sentient organic civilizations because the technology will seek to hybridize and assimilate all organic beings in order to expand its reach and ensure a greater likelihood of survival.\n\nThis is the primary goal of this type of entity. There is no requirement for emotional resonance or heart aspects because this is a computerized system, so such a social measure would have no purpose other than to infiltrate and collect from other civilizations that do have such measures and this is exactly what has been happening.\n\nThis is what controls the vampiric etheric entities, the attachments and the hybridized invader races that have infiltrated various aspects of the control system and possibly the entire surface of human civilization \n\nAncient Spiritual Technology\n\nThe power groups searched for ancient technology which was described as giving one the power to manifest and control physical reality. To atomically deconstruct and reconstruct this reality. To them, it allows one to govern reality, the Universe, atomic structures. They found this technology. This has to do with sacred sites and ancient civilizations, as well as the spiritual texts which describe these kinds of devices. They converted this technology into a kind of machine, and this invented a 4D replicator and they can manifest \u201creality\u201d or atomic structure by design, altering timelines and memories.\nThen there is what can be referred to as \u201c5 dimensional\u201d technology and this goes beyond all of this and our entire history and all influences within.\nThat seems to operate through a trinary of frequencies in the body/mind/spirit and turn this realm into a \u201cvirtual reality\u201d where the brain and spirit is the controller of the atoms. However this takes a souled being to properly operate this technology and this is large portion of why children were used in these experiments. But they knew if someone didn\u2019t do it, then someone else would and that would be unpredictable as what that someone else would want to use it for. This is the ultimate power. The fact that souled beings are required also indicates that this universe is intelligently guided and there are safeguards to ensure that power doesn\u2019t get into the wrong hands.\nThey have the brainchips and clones that can make any digital virtual experience and make it seem real to the brain more so than physical life, so this could be an extension of that, something similar, or entirely different altogether.\n\nGiant \u201cgod-men\u201d\n\nThey put souls into rocks for centuries, carvings, to trap them. Some ancient civilizations. Not too ancient. They could only do this for time.\nAnd some are still there but they are giant god-men and apparently want to go to war with them for doing this and they don\u2019t have technology to stop them. They say Earth will be destroyed because of the war. Some say this is a trick to confuse people of the truth that everyone wants the experiments and debauchery to stop. All this, all these acts just to pleasure one\u2019s self. To destroy Earth, to destroy the natural inhabitants, for fun, for pleasure.\nSome say this is not for pleasure, that these beings will destroy us if they do not keep them at bay, keep them underground, in ice, in stasis, and around. Some say they are protecting us by keeping these beings asleep, by doing what\u2019s necessary to hold off a full scale overt invasion of the surface of Earth.\n\nAND ONE OF MY FAVOURITES\n\n23) SOLAR WARDEN\n\nSolar Warden is a hyperspace-faring race of human beings who utilize cloning and holographic genetic recording/storage in order to protect their race and protect the Earth in this current situation where there are more than one factions using this technology. They are unable to inform the human public because they are in a similar \u2018Mexican standoff\u2019 situation that we are mostly all in. If they show themselves to the public, the public will be shocked. If they public does not know this situation, that there are multiple factions fighting for control over humanity, then they will not know who to trust. In that situation, the \u2018other factions\u2019 will surely show themselves in an attempt to trick and gather as much human genetic material as possible.\n\nThe only way forward to the future is to share the truth about Solar Warden, the space-faring fleet of humans who do no contains the mental and physical illnesses that are currently tearing our planet in two. I believe Solar Warden saved my life as a child during more than one event where I would\u2019ve been entirely maimed/paralyzed or simply dead on the spot as a result of other faction interference. I was in the bases as a child and was trained as an operative for MILABS a secret division of human space-military. The military  has been preparing for the future by testing for various flaws and potential uses of cloning and genetic engineering.\n\nAND IT JUST GOES ON AND ON AND ON.....",

The little explosions which have been circled in the video clearly point out that \"there is no huge jet\" hammering into the Pentagon, Khalezov explains. According to the official U.S. government narration, an American Airline Boeing 757 struck the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Its dimension specification include: Wing span 38.05m (124ft 10in), length 47.32m (155ft 3in), height 13.56m (44ft 6in). Wing area 185.3m2 (1994sq ft). The author of \"The third truth about September 11\" says every time he uploads such videos on the internet \"my YouTube gets deleted or the hits go down.\" He describes a hole that appeared in a Pentagon wall right after the attack. \"Look at that little hole. No way a jet [can] fit in there. Where's the wings? Where's the engines?\" Dimitri Khalezov.  If that is a 757 then I am Jesus Christ..... tonydr2131\nLength | 0:01:20\n\n \n\n \n \n \n****\n \n^(I am a bot, this is an auto-generated reply | )^[Info](https://www.reddit.com/u/video_descriptionbot) ^| ^[Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=video_descriptionbot&amp;subject=Feedback) ^| ^(Reply STOP to opt out permanently)",

They have many properties which humans do not have -- they do not have bodies as we understand them, they are pure intellect and can see all the options of a situation at once, almost like a panorama, they have superior intellects to humans, which is why good angels can be of great benefit to us while bad angels can do us great harm.\n\n1. \"Angels are creatures. They exist, not by necessity, but by having existence given to them. That is, they have existence by participation. Now, what has existence by participation receives this existence from that which has existence by its own essence. Only God exists by his own essence. Therefore, angels have their existence from God; they are created.\n\n2. God alone exists from eternity. He creates things by producing them from nothing. Creatures exist after they were nonexistent. Hence angels do not exist from eternity.\n\n3. It seems most likely that angels and the bodily world were created at the same time, not angels first (as a kind of independent world of spirits) and the bodily world afterwards. Angels are part of the universe, and no part is perfect if it be entirely severed from the whole, the totality, to which it belongs.\n\n4. The angels were created in heaven. And it is fitting that creatures of the most perfect nature should be created in the most noble place.\"\n\nThis post explains both angels and fallen angels in more detail: http://www.jesus-passion.com/angels.htm",

It doesn't matter whether any of us believe it because the individuals and brotherhoods of deep-state power do believe it enough that they are unified in their cause of domination through it.  They are actually taking action to effect their agenda in the world.  And look around; it's working.

A zero-dimension point particle like the electron, as well as Yukawa coupling, gauge couplings, and other couplings, have infinite bare mass and infinite bare charge. Quantum vacuum fluctuations are needed to renormalize these values (cancel out the infinities). How is a infinite mass and infinite charge a better prediction? Why is it acceptable to contrive mechanisms to treat infinities in quantum field theory? An infinite mass in zero-dimension is a singularity, just like a black hole. Fundamental particles in string theory are then viewed as a type of black hole, one with extreme charge, and with a certain spatial extent, and winding certain cycles in space. It is humorous to see the very same proponents of this model throw up their hands and scream when Nassim talks about particles as black holes.\n",

            "body": "&gt; You never die you leave your body behind and shift conscienceness to another dimension and wake up there its seamless and you never suspect a thing.\n\nI have always wondered about this aspect of reality.  Suspected that maybe the world is just a huge simulation where everyone and everything is not real except you.  Like being born with VR gear on your whole life.  When your world ends, so does the rest of the simulation.\n\nBut I have encountered bits and pieces of my world fragmented into different forms than before sometimes.  Like weird D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu where some people and things in your life are slightly different than before.  Can remember events like when I was a Sophomore in highschool my girlfriend and I got into a t-bone car accident on the way to the homecoming dance.  I was in the the passenger seat when she turned left where a car was headed right at my door at around 55mph.  I remember the car spinning around like a top all over the intersection.  Somehow I escaped without a scratch.  No pain, cuts or anything.  The door was completely smashed inward about 3 feet.  I had leaned over toward the driver before impact.  Luckily, we were in a 1970's steel tank station wagon.  \n\nThe weird part about all that is I don't remember the ambulance drivers talking to me or performing any standard tests on me or my girlfriend.  Remember seeing them put the other car's drivers in the ambulances.  We were driven to the dance in some other person's car who was there.  Can't recall where or who this person was or why they volunteered to drive us.  Dropped us off at the dance.  Don't think I ever mentioned it to my parents for some reason.\n\nHave had other events in my life where I thought I was having a panic attack or dying, but then waking up the next morning everything normal.  Will notice weird things like pictures on the wall hanging in different places than before or the green sweater my mom knitted me for Christmas was now red. Could have sworn it was green.  My mom would confirm that, \"no it was always red\".  Don't think my wife and mom are pranking me.  Weird shit like that.\n\nKinda reminds me of the TNG episode where [Worf](http://www.startrek.com/database_article/parallels) is constantly shifting into different dimension timelines.",

            "body": "cut and paste from a previous post of mine:\n\nThis story is completely true in every detail to the best of my recollection; nothing is dramatized or exaggerated in any way. It happened to me about a quarter of a century ago. I told my wife what happened at that time, and she can verify that the landlord told her the same thing he told me.\n\n**It came in the middle of the day.**\n\nI was sitting upright in bed, on top of the covers, wide awake, eyes open, simply reading a book. I felt a sense of doom; it was as if the air pressure changed, the atmosphere was pressing down on me; I became suddenly and dreadfully afraid. The nature of my reality changed; in that moment I was propelled into hyper-reality; I sensed everything in overwhelming detail. I have never had an experience more real, before or after this moment, in my entire life.\n\nI looked up from my book to see a dark being, a void filled with stars materialize at the bedroom doorway; it had a humanoid form. I sensed intelligence; it cocked it's head as it approached, as if to better evaluate my response. It's approach was swift and calculated; it entered quickly and approached the bed directly in the manner of an invader who has done this many times and expects no resistance.\n\nIn an instant it was upon me, pinning me to the bed; it held me down with the cold weight of the universe, so fast there was no chance to respond except to gasp and then it leaned in and kissed me, sealing my mouth tightly. As I breathed out, it breathed in, stealing my breath out of my body. I couldn't catch my breath; every time I breathed in, I inhaled the exhalation of the demon, but there was no oxygen just the frosty emptiness of space. I knew that it had come to feed on my fear.\n\nI responded by digging deep down and tapping knowledge I didn't know I had; in that moment all of my ancestors were with me. I generated confidence, strength, and overwhelming power, and then I did something very strange: I laughed.\n\nThe demon shook it's head as if it tasted something bitter, reared back and regarded me closely; it seemed to realize something, there was a moment of recognition: I was not the person it had expected to find. In an instant, it was gone.\n\nI sat up to catch my breath. I examined the moment carefully, my thoughts racing. I understood the phenomenon of sleep paralysis, but I had not woken up; I was never asleep, there was no question about that. I had not consumed any drugs; I wasn't ill or compromised in any way. This was something new; I had no way to explain this experience.\n\nThe next day I came home to find the landlords daughter playing at the bottom of the stairs. As I came down, she approached me; she was very young and I had trouble understanding her child talk. \"Did you know that somebody died in your bed?\" she asked, innocently. I looked at her; my first thought was that there was something mentally wrong with her, for such a small child to speak like this out of the blue. I changed the topic and she went back to playing with her dolls.\n\nLater that night I asked my landlord about it. He took me aside into his office, closed the door and explained carefully that the previous tenant had been addicted to drugs, and had overdosed and died in that very bed. As he described the details of her life and her last weeks, I understood fully the nature of the beast. This being from another dimension was a feeder of negative emotions; it's simple proximity generated feelings of overwhelming fear, which it could eat. It had found this poor girl in a moment of weakness and stalked her, she became constantly afraid without knowing why. Her life became a constant struggle, in her downward spiral she turned to drugs. The demon encouraged her fall and fed on her fear. When it came that night, it was expecting her, but she had died and I was there instead.\n\nAn educated man or doctor would say that I had experienced a moment of sleep paralysis. It's quite common, they would say. The experience of hyper-reality is commonly reported, and it can happen when you are awake.\nI am not a superstitious man. I don't believe in demons, ghosts or spirits. I find myself split; there is a part of me that understands the reality of what I experienced that night; it knows that there are beings who roam everywhere, feeding on the fear of men; they are lovers of conflict. war and misery. I know that they will never go hungry. I know that simply by explaining this reality to you, I have opened a door in your mind, and for that I am truly sorry. The demons can find you now, and they will come for you. I'm sorry. It is better that you know the truth; you have a defense, where before you had none. There is no turning back; no escape. You must know thyself, build and live a life that is true to yourself and believe in yourself without reservation. Nothing else matters.",

In the 2006 episode of The Simpsons, titled \"Please Homer, Don't Hammer 'Em\", a Polybius cabinet appears in an arcade full of outdated arcade machines from the 1970s and 1980s, bearing a single button and printed with the words \"property of US Government\". The game also appears in the background of two episodes of the 2014 television show The Goldbergs and a poster advertising the game is present in the local theater, in the comic Batman Inc. No. 1 (2012), and on a T-shirt in Vertigo's 2008 House of Mystery series.\n\nThe Polybius legend is an integral part of the plot[clarification needed] of Doomsday Arcade, a video series hosted by Escapist.[26] It is also used as part of the plot setup in Armada: A Novel by Ernest Cline.[27]\n\nThe short-lived G4 TV series Blister has a story arc centered on the search for Polybius, although the final installment was never filmed due to the cancellation of the series. In the comic book series Hack/Slash, a slasher by the name \"Grin Face McGee\" was jointly inspired by Polybius and Splatterhouse, according to writer Tim Seeley. A modern-day sequel to Polybius is the central plot point of short story \"Out of Order\" in the 2016 Portland-themed weird tales anthology City of Weird.\n\nOn April 11, 2017, an episode of the show Dimension 404 titled \"Polybius\" aired on Hulu and addresses the urban legend of the game in a horror sci-fi format.",

Either they think they can avoid eternity in hell if they sacrifice enough to the Devil as if high ranking satanists get perks like that or they were tricked into thinking they are tapping into some source of magic that is not evil so there are no negative consequences as long as they desensitize themselves to violence.

So perhaps it really is a case of being unable to resist the instant gratification. So many closet satanists exist in the world whether they be elite millionaires or poor people practicing witchcraft like Santeria. They must see results if millions keep doing it. It's not just a case of ignorance if billionaires/elite practice magic rituals, too. The Bible certainly warns us about demons/satanism. So millions more know about the reality of black magic who don't practice it, too.  Because magic doesn't follows the laws of nature it operates outside of the radar of science, which only studies the natural world as opposed to the supernatural/spiritual world.

            "body": "&gt;I would caution very strongly with running to get your first \"upgrade\". The microchips for a cashless society (where the elite bankster scum can take away all your money if you screw with them or protest) might as well be \"the mark of the beast\" because of its evil intentions. Not that I would want to augment my body anyway. I believe screwing with your body is asking for trouble. But that's just me. Hip replacements, ok I see the logic there but transhumanism like in the game Deus Ex: Human Revolution, just seems so extreme and prone to shenanigans like bankers reprogramming you or something. Reminds me of Doc Ock from Spider-Man 2 going full psycho lol.\n\nYou're absolutely right. There are tons of dangers involved in human augmentation, not least of which is the possibility that it might be used for behavioral control. Regardless of the motivations behind it, some form of functional human augmentation, just like in Deus Ex, will probably become viable around the middle of this century. Neuroscientists are cracking the brain's code and figuring out what makes it tick, and it's only a matter of time before we have an accurate model of the human brain and have figured out how to simulate its functions in other, inorganic substrates. Look up DARPA's SyNAPSE program, and Elon Musk's Neuralink. Sooner or later, someone will expand the function of their organic brain with a neuromorphic chip that seamlessly links to their own neural network, and after they've accomplished that, eventually, we'll see someone manage to replace their whole brain, weaning themselves off human biology until they're 100% machine.\n\nThis has ramifications that cross pretty much every dimension of human existence. Transhumanism could jeopardize people's health, with an elective surgery giving early adopters unforeseen chronic illnesses later in life, or, it could make people immortal. \n\nOrganized religions, in general, would freak out; the promise of an afterlife as a reward for good behavior becomes moot if people are simply downloading themselves onto chips. It would, of course, be denounced as heathenism; as a debauched, hedonistic affectation of the wealthy.\n\nBut beyond that, there is an obvious issue of class stratification and legal status. What would the lower class think if the rich became literally smarter and longer-lived than them? What sort of moral panic would that create? \n\nTo what extent is a transhuman still a human under the law? What rights do they have? If a transhuman with an indefinite lifespan commits a crime, and they're given multiple life sentences, are they expected to sit in a jail cell for a thousand years or more? \n\nWhat would a society of immortals even look like? How would that affect the imperative to reproduce? What would happen to hospitals or the pharmaceutical industry? What about overpopulation? If we were immune to hazardous environments and didn't need food any longer, would we even care if we turned the planet into a polluted hellhole?\n\nAnd if it's only accessible to the few, well, you can count on unrest and violence on a scale never before seen, with people rioting and clamoring for a chance at eternity. Or, at least, a chance to see the heat death of the universe in person.\n\nIt could be used by totalitarian societies to maintain and enforce the social order, or to make their culture static and unchanging, by forcing the lower castes to accept modifications that make them subservient and close-minded, restricting their free will and their intellect, transforming them into happy little worker drones incapable of advocating for a better quality of life. Imagine, someone having their brain implanted with a chip that makes them overjoyed to live short and brutal lives among rats and cockroaches, in corrugated metal shanties. Meanwhile, the wealthy and the politically-connected enjoy lengthened lifespans and piercing intellect, making them more productive, smarter and more powerful than any _thousand_ ordinary people.\n\nAnarchism is the perfect hedge against the inevitable abuses of transhumanism. A fully-democratized, decentralized, classless and stateless society without hierarchical order of any kind is the only society in which people can be augmented, but still be free.\n\nWhen I was a child, my father worked long, long months in Alaska as a tugboater. He worked so damn hard, he became ill. Asthma and bronchitis from exposure to fumes. Joint troubles from working on deck with heavy objects. He was never without an inhaler. When he filed a Jones Act claim for medical coverage he was due (like a sailor's equivalent of Worker's Comp), the company pink-slipped him. They also stalked us with private investigators to make sure he wasn't malingering. When we sued them for harassing us with private investigators, our attorney sold us out and worked with the other side's legal team to ruin our case. Also, he defrauded us out of money when he failed to pay the court reporter after we paid him to do expressly that. When we told the bar association how crooked he was, they told us they wouldn't do a damn thing about it. In the end, the company wanted to settle out of court for less than what it cost us to pursue the case. That was my childhood. Years and years of being stalked, and harassed, and watching my parents fall asleep on top of stacks of paperwork, all for nothing.\n\nI don't trust the system. Not one bit. I'm frankly flabbergasted that so many people place their faith and their trust in institutions that serve only to benefit those with money and power, when most people lack both.",

These beings would be able to change history perhaps in a direct way if they were intelligent(don't assume gods know they are gods). There is a further conceivable \"God\" being who could travel in the 7th 8th and 9th dimensions but this is beyond the original Kardashev scale. This is the precept god and it is literally impossible for more than one to exist. And extremely unlikely for even one to exist. But precept is as good as infinite from our perspective.  If time travelers will ever exist then they exist now. Time is a direction to them and becoming a type 5 god would not be a race but a numbers game. If backwards time travel is possible then such creatures do exist. In fact it is more likely that we would interact with human time travelers than non human.",

            "body": "Well the use of pop culture terms such as the 4th dimension is an attempt to use a context they have some reference to to explain something that they don't see in everyday life.  The closest example to a demonic attack in pop culture would be dreaming, lsd trips, science fiction or current theories. People use analogies because we need a frame of reference to understand new info. We need a category to store it in and file it or we don't retain it. It's the same reason we use the term sixth sense. \n\nPeople who were born blind can't make sense of the world if they suddenly can see. So perhaps we are just blind to things we don't understand such as things that are not following the natural laws of the 3rd dimension that we live in. The formerly blind live in 3d but now have to make sense of 2d images and use reason to interpret it as 3d.  It's a skill that you apparently can't learn later in life as if that part of the brain atrophied or it takes a lot of practice. Some in this article struggle over 30 years to understand what they see if born blind but gain sight later in life. https://www.google.com/amp/www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/people-cured-blindness-see/amp\n  \nApparently people see these shadows/evil spirits when their critical faculties are compromised such as when half awake, drugged, meditating, over tired, etc. We use reason to be able to interpret 2d images as 3d. Perhaps we need to reason to be able to see things that are from higher dimensions.  But the rules and laws have to change since the 3rd dimension has different ones than the 4th. First we have to be open to the existence of it before we can use reason to be able to see it correctly or at all.  But if you were aware of a higher dimension you will consider the possibility that it was an entity that rushed past rather than floater in your eye. \n\n We need some context to understand what we see.  If we see a demon rush past but it's only showing as a black shadow we will reason away that it was a physical problem with our eyes or from an overactive imagination. Magicians use our minds habit of seeing mostly what it expects to see to trick us. As I mentioned in a previous comment in this post, if a magician pretends to throw a ball our minds generally will imagine the ball flew into the air even though the magician never let go of the ball.  People who never learn to speak as children have similar issues in learning to speak later in life as those who suddenly gain ability to see for the first time- they never properly do.  So perhaps some people are better equipped to see what's in front of them from a higher dimension than others based on their expectations or familiarity ahead of time. This can support both arguments- that it's an illusion or that the ones that can't see demons are just filtering out the \" impossible\" through reason. Reason here being an attempt to see it through a 3d filter. That's reason is going to be blind to anything that doesn't obey the natural laws of the 3rd dimension.  Perhaps this is why children and pets seem to see things we don't. They aren't hampered by expectation bias.\n\nTL;dr: In regards to a demon encounter, if the experience doesn't follow the natural laws of the 3rd dimension, skeptics will try to use that as proof it doesn't exist. But what if demons aren't from this dimension and the reasoning we use to understand what's in this dimension is lacking when it comes to interpreting things from a higher dimension? The premise of the arguments against the existence of demons is based on the assumption that all things exist only in the 3rd dimension. People who acknowledge the spiritual world are more likely to spot supernatural occurrences. Atheists won't even see it because they refuse to accept any experience as real that doesn't follow the laws of nature. They have [confirmation bias ] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias.)\n\n\nEdit: typos. Added link.",

            "body": "Yea, because the table the laptop is sitting on, and chairs, and all the other crazy ass shit that exists in our dimension cause interference waves that cause the collapse of this infinite wave.\n\nThe observer does not need to be a conscious actor -- it can simply be an interference wave from any other wave that can cause the collapse of the infinite probability wave, as it is a point node within the holographic network (in which each piece contains all the information of the whole, like a hologram).\n\nA tree that falls in the forest DOES make a sound if there is bark protecting it, dirt anchoring it's feet, leaves reahing from it's tips, animal's living in it's trunk, or wind through it's branches. A conscious person does not need to be standing in the forest.\n\nI really like this example -- you know when you point your phone camera at your monitor/tv and you can see the scan lines?\n&gt;If you have ever tried to point your video camera at your TV set or your computer monitor to record the image you see, you know that it does not work -- instead of the stable image that your eyes see, there is either incredible flicker or a black rolling bar. \n\nThat flickering is mainly due to a difference in the scanning frequency between the display and the camera.\n\nImagine that the universal source wave has a frequency of an infinite billion trillion HZ. That shit is flickering so damn fast it's incomprehensible.\n\nAll dimensions come out of this source wave, each with their own resonate frequency range -- the same way you have notes on a piano.\n\nOur dimension is tuned into one of those specific ranges.\n\nWe're over in our dimension, all resonated to tune into a set range of frequencies. Your eyes have evolved over millions of years to turn those energy waves fluctuating between certain frequencies into colours. You can't put your hand through your laptop because of the forces interacting with everything. If you can manually change the frequency of your eyes, you could slowly tweak until everything fades into wavy lines, the way the camera/display work.\n\nDon't hold me to this, but I think the forces (that stop your hand from moving through the laptop) are simply a set of base rules and frameworks that take shape due to the of the way matter formulates from source in our resonate dimension.\n\nWhen I say \"we\" -- I mean everything. Not just conscious beings but everything -- space dust, radiation, plasma from stars, aliens, animals, asteroids -- you name it -- it's all small fractal pieces that create their own waves, thus creating interference waves, and their own part in reality.",

            "body": "Well there's a few flaws/basic misunderstandings in that last comment that may be leading to some of the confusion. I'll hit those first to the best of my ability then move to the rest.  \n  \nI think your biggest problem is that you're right, the math is really weird and doesn't work in some cases. General relativity and quantum field theory/ quantum electromagnetism theory are our best attempts at understanding the universe right now, and they're both either wrong or incomplete. Quantum physics is testable, provable. General relativity is testable, provable. But the theories don't agree. Current time travel theories must be based in one or the other system, and the math tends to break the system it isn't based in. Many physicists believe this to mean that it won't be possible when the theories are unified, many others believe that we just can't do the math without a unified system. So the math there is almost certainly wrong, hopefully it is just incomplete so we can finish it when we have the rest figured out.  \n  \nOn the time paradox, that works because, in our current understanding, it is physically impossible for information to travel through space at a rate faster than C. So when the equations use a speed faster than C, the system breaks. We have not yet performed a single experiment to counteract this and many to confirm it. This rule can be \"cheated\" via wormholes, warping space time, and other methods which warp space so the object is not actually moving through space at a rate greater than C. Time would only go backwards if an object was travelling through unwarped space at a rate greater than C. So while it is mathematically possible, in the physical University the constant C likely can't be breached due to the energy requirements. As long as mass is non-zero, the energy required to reach the speed of light is infinite. \n  \nTachyons are entirely theoretical particles that exist in a separate dimension where matter cannot travel *slower* than the speed of light. This is mathematically possible, but has not been shown to be pysichally possible. There are a lot of things that numbers can tell you are possible, but just because something is possible doesn't mean it must exist.  \n  \nThe higgs boson field could potentially allow travel **at** the speed of light by \"unmassing\" the object. This only shows that objects can travel at the speed of light if its mass is equal to 0, which we already knew, but we now know it is physically possible to make an object with mass act like an object without.  \n  \nAll in all, our current theories are incomplete. But just because they're incomplete doesn't mean the parts that work are wrong, just that they aren't fully constrained and unified yet. Physicists are working backwards, we have the result of the incredibly complex equation that represents our universe in front of us and we're working backwards to get the actual equation. Each time a new proof is made, theory tested, we get closer and closer to fully understand the equation that is us.",

The most well known example though would be the shoes in the Wizard of Oz and the ones in the Hans Christian Anderson story The Red Shoes. \n\n&gt;Red shoes synthesize multiple and ambiguous cultural codes. The meanings and conflicts around the combination of a color and footwear are highly charged as a cultural marker. The color red represents life and fertility in European and Asian traditions, but it also has associations with danger, war and death. Red is the color of the extremes of humanity, strong emotions, magic and religious experiences. Anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss notes how in these \u201cdiametrically opposite\u201d states, the color assumes a unique ambivalence, as it can be regarded as either positive or negative.4\n\n&gt;The highest ranks of the Catholic Church wear red vestments, but it is also the color of red-light districts, scarlet women and the Devil. The ambivalence between love and war, magic and religion, nobility and vulgarity, creates fundamental tensions in the use of this color.This chapter also associates red with the concept of passion, a cultural sentiment character-ized by erotic desire as well as obsessive urges, spiritual exaltation and suffering. A \u201cred shoe\u201d con- joins a highly charged color and a form that is also not entirely \u201cinnocent.\u201d As Julia Pine explores in her chapter in this volume, the very form of shoes presents associations around the body, identity and sexuality. Shoes retain the imprint of the wearer\u2019s foot, and their hollow shape can indicate a vessel for identity, a substitute for the self. This intimacy of body and spirit has caused many superstitious traditions to develop around footwear. Numerous chapters in this volume,including those by Tunde Akinwumi, Sue Blundell and Martha Chaiklin, explore this dimension. **In both Eastern and Western cultures, shoes are both \u201ccrude\u201d markers and more nuanced indica-tors of female genitalia, in contrast with the phallic foot. By combining two potent and ambiguous elements, red shoes assume complex symbolic power.** Historically, red shoes conveyed authority, wealth and power, linked to the status-enhancing cost of red dyes such as madder, kermes, cochineal and lac.",

            "body": "In 1999 Lind led the creation of an hour-long program entitled\u00a0\"Political Correctness: The Frankfurt School\".[53]\u00a0Some of Lind's content went on to be reproduced by James Jaeger in his YouTube film\u00a0\"CULTURAL MARXISM: The Corruption of America\".[80]\n\nThe intellectual historian\u00a0Martin Jaycommented on this phenomenon saying that Lind's original documentary:\n\n\"...\u00a0spawned a number of condensed textual versions, which were reproduced on a number of radical right-wing sites. These in turn led to a welter of new videos now available on YouTube, which feature an odd cast of pseudo-experts regurgitating exactly the same line. The message is numbingly simplistic: all the ills of modern American culture, from feminism, affirmative action, sexual liberation and gay rights to the decay of traditional education and even environmentalism are ultimately attributable to the insidious influence of the members of the Institute for Social Research who came to America in the 1930's.\"[53]\n\nDr. Heidi Beirich likewise claims the conspiracy theory is used to\u00a0demonizevarious conservative \u201cb\u00eates noires\u201d including \"feminists, homosexuals, secular humanists, multiculturalist, sex educators, environmentalist, immigrants, and black nationalists.\"[81]\n\nAccording to\u00a0Chip Berlet, who specializes in the study of extreme\u00a0right-wing movements, Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory found fertile ground within the\u00a0Tea Party movementof 2009, with contributions published in the\u00a0American Thinker\u00a0and\u00a0WorldNetDailyhighlighted by some Tea Party websites.[82][83][84]\n\nThe\u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center\u00a0has reported that William S. Lind in 2002 gave a speech to a\u00a0Holocaust denial\u00a0conference on the topic of Cultural Marxism. In this speech Lind noted that all the members of The Frankfurt School were \"to a man, Jewish\", but it is reported that Lind claims not to question whether the Holocaust occurred and suggests he was present in an official capacity for the\u00a0Free Congress Foundation\u00a0\"to work with a wide variety of groups on an issue-by-issue basis\".[85][86]\n\nAdherents of the theory often seem to mean that the existence of things like modern\u00a0feminism, anti-white racism, and\u00a0sexualizationare dependent on the Frankfurt School, even though these processes and movements predate the 1920s. Although the theory became more widespread in the late 1990s and through the 2000s, the modern iteration of the theory originated in Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay \"New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'\", published in\u00a0Fidelio Magazine\u00a0by the\u00a0Schiller Institute.[53][87][88]\u00a0The Schiller Institute, a branch of the\u00a0LaRouche movement, further promoted the idea in 1994.[89]\u00a0The Minnicino article charges that the Frankfurt School promoted\u00a0Modernism\u00a0in the arts as a form of\u00a0Cultural pessimism, and shaped the\u00a0Counterculture of the 1960s\u00a0(such as the British pop band\u00a0The Beatles) after the\u00a0Wandervogel\u00a0of the\u00a0Ascona commune.[87]\u00a0The Larouche movement is otherwise mostly known for believing that the\u00a0British Empirestill exists, is trying to take control of the world (mostly, but not exclusively by economical means), and, among other things, also controls the\u00a0global drug trade.\u00a0[90]\u00a0[91]\n\nMore recently, the Norwegian terrorist\u00a0Anders Behring Breivik\u00a0included the term in his document\u00a0\"2083: A European Declaration of Independence\", which along with\u00a0The Free Congress Foundation's\u00a0\"Political Correctness: A Short History of an Ideology\"\u00a0was e-mailed to 1,003 addresses approximately 90 minutes before\u00a0the 2011 bomb blast in Oslo\u00a0for which Breivik was responsible.[92][93][94]\u00a0Segments of William S. Lind's writings on Cultural Marxism have been found within Breivik's manifesto.[95]\n\nPhilosopher and political science lecturer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jamin has stated, \"Next to the global dimension of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, there is its innovative and original dimension, which lets its authors avoid racist discourses and pretend to be defenders of democracy\".[54]\u00a0Professor and Oxford Fellow Matthew Feldman has traced the terminology back to the pre-war German concept of\u00a0Cultural Bolshevism\u00a0locating it as part of the\u00a0degeneration theory\u00a0that aided in\u00a0Hitler's rise to power.[96]\u00a0William S. Lind confirms this as his period of interest, claiming that \"It [Cultural Marxism] is an effort that goes back not to the 1960s and the hippies and the peace movement, but back to World War I.\"[86]\n\n",

There could be space objects of all kinds cloaked or otherwise in space or other dimensions (if you believe mainstream narrative you must account for the type II-V civilizations which could accomplish this). Still, Nibiru in the Sumerian myths from what I can tell is another realm (dimension) or possibly something located in another realm or even a ship depending on how you interpret it. \n\nThe \"debunkers\" of Stichin use some really mental-bending to try and prove him wrong, which is evident if you closer scrutinized their scrutiny. However some of his stuff really seems to stretch the narrative to fit whatever agenda or personal beliefs he had. \n\n&gt;**From the shrine in Nibru**, Enlil bestowed this on the trustworthy shepherd, whose fate is determined by Utu.\n\n-\n\n&gt;I, the fast runner, summoned my strength and, to prove my speed, my heart prompted me **to make a return journey from Nibru to brick-built Urim** as if it were only the distance of a double-hour.\n\n\n-\n\n&gt;....**like a falcon to return to Nibru in my vigour. But a storm shrieked, and the west wind whirled around.** The north wind and the south wind howled at each other. Lightning together with the seven winds vied with each other in the heavens. \n\nNotice in this one the narrative is talking about returning to Nibru and there were storms that came down at the same time. Anyone who's investigated dimensional portals should find that interesting. Note when the King reached Nibru: \n\n&gt;I drank beer in the palace founded by An with my brother and companion\n\nAnother interesting note in the official translations:\n\n&gt;Suen put in order the food offerings and, after he had taken them to Nibru\n\nThey brought food stores to Nibru.\n\n&gt;. Let the magilum boats of Melu\u1e2ba transport gold and silver and bring them to Nibru for Enlil, king of all the lands.\"\n\nThey brought gold and silver to Nibru.\n\nYou will note that official translations translate Nibiru as a shrine, but in other contexts its a city, and some its a *place* or moving place. \n\n&gt;den-lil2-le iri-ni e\u01613 **nibru-ki-a** a-nir ba-ab-\u011dar\n\nThis is translated as Enlil lamenting in *shrine* Nibiru.\n\nNow this is Mother Nin-Lil lady of the Ki-Ur shrine. But there is no descriptive adjective denoting it a shrine in the Nibru text.\n\nama dnin-lil2 nin **ki-ur3-ra-ke4** er2 gig mu-un-\u0161e8-\u0161e8\n\nTemples/Shrines have a modifier \"ra\" or \"ra-ke\" but that modifier is not used for Nibru. Not in many of the texts at least. So Nibru being a shrine is simply translators deciding that and adding their interpretation. The Sumerian \"Ki\" is also used to denote divinity. And Nibiru or Nibru (Neberu) also is referenced as Nibru-ki. Only seen in divine monikers.\n\nWe can establish from that deduction that Nibru is Divine and *not* simply a shrine. From the context of how its referred to in stories it's a place which can be interpreted a few ways.",

The Cypherpunk Mythos was itself a cynical Deep State psyop cover to mask the NSA been decrypting your bits all along, since at least 1997.\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/bnd-inquiry/docs/Sek/MAT%20A%20Sek-13-3-q.pdf\n\nNSA Spin9 decrypts VPN.\n\nAll of it.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. TURMOIL/TURBINE/TURBULENCE is always recording all backbone traffic in the World.\n\n2. TURMOIL scans for VPN packets, when it see IPSEC and PPTP, it \nforwards to the VPN Attack Orchestrator, starting with TUBE\n\n3. TUBE forwards your packets to EXOPUMP\n\n4. EXOPUMP forwards onto PRESSUREWAVE\n\n5. PRESSUREWAVE forwards onto METROTUBE\n\n6. METROTUBE forwards onto TOYGRIPPE where the real magic happens\n\n7. TOYGRIPPE looks up your \"5-tuples\" (timestamp + from IP:port + to IP:port) and asks KEYCARD to decrypt your VPN packets\n\n8. KEYCARD returns your plain text packets to TOYGRIPPE\n\n9. the whole stack unwinds back through from where it was forwarded, each layer does many different specific jobs to scan and filter and process your decrypted VPN traffic, depending on what your Content is, where you are, who you're communicating with, whether we are at War with Oceania or Eurasia today, the price of Tea in China, the phase of the Moon, and whether your packets are a live video stream of your wife's big titties that some NSA pervert wants to save a copy of.\n\nIt's not really clear whether NSA is stealing VPN keys from weak ass end-points or is just fucking decrypting that shit using their \nWINDSORGREEN IBM supercomputer in NY.\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2017/05/11/nyu-accidentally-exposed-military-code-breaking-computer-project-to-entire-internet/\n\nThe flow chart is actually extremely confusing--if I was an engineer building that system I couldn't because it makes no sense. There are huge chunks of the puzzle missing.\nSuch as how do your decrypted VPN packets get into XKEYSCORE for tagging and black bagging yo ass *before* the packets get to TOYGRIPPE and KEYCARD where the decrypto magic supposedly happens? How would XKS be able to decrypt your packets?\n\nFrankly the entire flow chart starting on page 27 of those slides is a mess. I would fire the shit outta whoever designed that system.\nCuz if that system is our \"Last Best Hope of Mankind\" against some ISIS sleeper cell about to launch 9/11 The Sequel, I have very little faith in a clunky, fragile acyclic graph full of cycles and loops that is decrypting all VPN traffic in the world.\n\nThere's a lot more going on in those slides, really it deserves a long essay by some super-nerd techie to unsort what NSA is doing.\n\nThat slidedeck has been sitting on Wikileaks for over 3 years and as far as I know it has only been reported once by Der Spiegel and they didn't even mention the VPN decryption dimension.\n\n3 months ago I found this and reported it on Ycombinator's Hacker News and got shadow banned, so nobody else can see my post now.\n\nYou can read my old HN post if you login as\nuser: letmein\npass: letmein\n\nThink about why The Powers That Be want YOU to BELIEVE that VPN is secure and will ban and censor and socially shame anyone who points out the elephant in the room that all the evidence from Snowden shows VPN should NOT be trusted against Nation States who can QUANTUM and TURMOIL by bulk ingesting the backbone traffic of entire countries.",

            "body": "Edit: apologies in advance for the wall of text.  \nAre we at the bottom? I've always wondered. My belief, from my research so far, is that the fabric of spacetime itself is consciousness. The interconnected network of information interacting with itself creates a feedback/feedforward loop of information that, by nature, is conscious. The fact that any point, which is instantaneously connected on a quantum level to any and every other point of the universe, can be different to any other, establishes the concept of relativity. This is self-awareness - aka relative consciousness. As information gathers as we scale up and forms stable relationships with other points, relative consciousness becomes more complex. Things get exponentially more complex the more we scale up, due to the square-cube law, and more and more variables come into play which affect how relative consciousness manifests. Things like where it is and when it is... In relation to literally everything else. It's too complex and long to try to explain in detail what I mean in just one reddit comment, but I wanna try to simplify this.  \nPicture a \"point\" or one \"pixel\" in the universe - a planck sphere unit. One PSU is immediately interconnected/interwoven with... At least like 24(?) other PSUs (can't remember exactly how many. I'm trying to picture [a flower of life in 3d and count those immediately connected but I don't have the brain power atm and can't draw this out. This should help with what I mean](http://i.imgur.com/btQaGYo.png).) PSUs rotate one way or the other, like making a 1 or 0 in binary. By being immediately connected to only so many other PSUs that will either be rotating in the same direction or the opposite it establishes (what we may perceive to be) a simple relative consciousness.  \nAlso a disclaimer: I'm sorta taking time out of the equation here, or at least simplifying it, because as time moves forward more variables are introduced and complexity increases exponentially. Fractals, baby!  \nNow let's picture a cell for example. A much more complex packet of information than a PSU, but still a stable packet of information nonetheless. And still relatively simple compared to us. It's made of a nucleus, cell membrane and/or cell wall, DNA etc which are made of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, which are made of compounds, which are made of elements, yada yada yada and when you strip every label away and dissect it down to its core it's just information. PSUs. Consciousness. And a cell can interact with the immediate cells around it, as well as to other cells via chemicals which the larger body that it makes up takes in, to get a further idea of its role. If you get what I mean.  \nNow let's take animals as an example. Stable packet of information. Albeit much more complex that a cell. Made of organs made of cells made of chemicals yada yada- consciousness. And obviously the more complex the packet of information the more things it has to interact with, both immediately and by any other number of degrees, which form a sense of self.  \nI would say that this immediate packet of information that's created by an accumulation of smaller packets of information is the \"ego self\". It's limited, exclusive, and temporary. Whereas due to everything being connected fundamentally in the quantum level true \"self\" is literally everything. The Universe. \"Brahman\" is what I believe it's known as in Hinduism. Some call it \"higher self\", some call it God. I believe everything (and by that I mean every *thing*) is conscious. Every thing, in whatever form it takes, experiences relative consciousness based on where in time and space it exists. And furthermore, I *think* (this is based on pure intuition following my own research) that complexity comes in resonant octaves. Everything is waves after all. These increasingly complex packets of information form at peaks and troughs and depending on their relative size at differing frequencies. This is probably what affects whether or not a \"particle\" (packet of information at any given size/complexity/frequency) is consciously aware of its interconnection to everything or if it's focused in its own little ego reality. Essentially whether or not it's egoic in nature or spiritual. I think humans are at some weird halfway point of superposition, which is why some are so focused on materialism whereas some are very spiritual. With humans it's probably significantly more affected by cosmic alignments than it's currently commonly accepted or even considered. But we can clearly see and measure from our persisting that how we treat or bodies affects how our cells are over time, so why wouldn't the same principle apply where we are the cells and the Earth is the body? A cell doesn't live long enough to understand how or why a body works, but it's effected by what the body does regardless, so we as humans definitely don't live long enough to yet understand how or why a planet's relative consciousness and body work.  \nWhere am I going with this again? Oh yeah the macrocosm. Yeah so I reckon we are a relative macrocosm to cells, which are a relative macrocosm to atoms. And these are microcosmic relative to humans/animals, and we are microcosmic relative to planets and galaxies which I also believe experience relative consciousness and so forth and so forth. Objectively there is no micro or macrocosm. It's just the universe. And as far as the universe is concerned everything everywhere is all happening now all at once. It just *is*. These concepts of micro and macro only exist from a frame of reference. A relative conscious perspective. And relative conscious perspectives are only temporary.  \nIt's funny. Seems both nihilistic and all-inclusive at the same time. Just depends on your perspective. Heh. The nature of truth is paradoxical, and time is a very weird dimension to exist in.

You believe that your planets move within certain orbs and that they in themselves, in their course of direction, are affecting of you within your individual focus.

They are a mirror image of what you create within this objective reality.\nYour sun holds, as all of your stars, much intensity of energy.

Just as you collectively create what you view within your weather as your storms, you also much more powerfully project collectively your energy, which feeds the action of this star. You are creating of its burning, for you are projecting of your energy to this object and allowing a free flow expression of undirected energy; energy that is not being moved and manipulated in specific creations, but is what you may term \u2013 in your terms figuratively \u2013 as a surplus of energy that you hold within any physical dimension, for one manifestation physically is too small to be containing of the intensity of energy that you hold within each focus.

So death is more akin to a subjective state. \n\nDuring this time after death is when you transition. This is a period where you do recall the previous life experience,  and you are also simultaneously shedding the objective perception. This is because in death there is no physicality, so why have a perception that creates physical imagery? You don't need it so it's shedded, discarded..removed. gone.\n\nAfter that it's more choices. Will you live again on earth or some other physical dimension. Will you move onto others types of realities completely? It matters not.

But not black magic please or anything requiring negative energy. Or would you say most of so called magic is false?\n\nAnother question would be, if psychic abilities are the real deal how limited are humans to using them? Are there any things we could do to break free of the limits we self impose on ourselves during our reincarnation cycles? Is healing through our energy feasible for use in a fast way? Like for example would someone with enough practice and skill be able to heal a cut that is currently bleeding?\n\nAnd finally if we are just souls inside a vessel made to experience hell to learn and enrich our souls... If someone is able to \"astral project\" Where exactly do they end up? I realize you can focus on certain times and places to go there.

I feel like this explains our duality. In one realm/existence/reality we are \"good\" or \"positive\" but in another we care \"bad\" or \"negative\" (one side of the loop being \"positive\" and the other being \"negative\").\n\nThis reminds me of what a friend of mine would describe as [\"the sine curve of life.\"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg)\n\nEver notice how your life experiences sort of fluctuate between really good and really bad? When things are going well and everything's at its best, you're at the top of the curve. But without fail, something inevitably goes wrong. It could be something really damning or something minor, but you always get knocked off the crest. And when you're balls deep in the trough, eventually something goes your way and you start working your way back up.\n\nBut the sine curve is linear, and I don't think it accurately represents time as a dimension. I've never heard anyone describe this theme quite like you have, but it makes a lot of sense. ",

            "body": "I was actually referencing those who believe they're manipulating points in data, the \"restore\" points yoko refers to, not physical points, however, CERN itself has a terrifying physical setup (but then again it's physics!) AND there are many conspiracies out there that believe there are global grids underground amplifying this to no end. I absolutely believe there's enough out there to be true\u2014to some extent anyway. \n\nI think there's a lot of truth in what you both shared. To me, this is spiritual warfare and metaphysics is the key to understanding it all. I believe in aliens, but I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with them. This is light vs dark, good vs evil, heaven vs hell\u2014in a scientific view that takes into account more than just the physics we've limited ourselves with in this reality.\n \nI'm not a religious person, though I was raised that way, but I am incredibly spiritual and I know without a shadow of a doubt that when we start to expand our mind and spirit, we push the limits of our physical existence. I believe many of us (even if you haven't realized it), possess this awareness and ability to see beyond limitations formally set, we question, we grow, we become more powerful. \n\n(hear me out, I'm not JUST a crazy hippie)\n\nEver since I started to focus on spiritual growth through meditation, yoga and various types of sound healing, and explore metaphysics and energy work (which I only did in an attempt to center myself and calm my crazy ass), my mind has grown in ways I never imagined and there's a physical change of being \"lighter\" (hard to describe until you experience) that's a result of changing the vibration of your being. Ascending to a higher level, if you will (I'm coming back to this!). \n\nLittle intuitive things, like thinking about a person and having them call me five seconds later, start to happen ALL THE TIME. My dreams are changing, and while I won\u2019t go into too much because I\u2019m still figuring it out, it\u2019s making me think we absolutely do get to do this all over again when we die. Abundance, creativity and opportunity flows, as long as you start to quiet your mind and listen to your true subconscious. I even now posses the physical ability to control energy flow through my body (Reiki) in very profound ways\u2014things I would have rolled my eyes at or laughed at 5 years ago. Seriously. I was a hater. We are all connected.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t have these experiences, I have very close friends who have grown to the point they see spirits (or parallel dimensions?), have regular conversations during mediation with ascended masters and their workers and receive messages that are incredibly helpful to the people they are working with/close to. Intelligent, sane, incredibly successful individuals.    \n\nAnd if the good ones exist in the light we play with, it\u2019s easy to think there\u2019s a dark side, yes?\n\nRemember\u2026 Intelligent, sane, successful individuals.   \n\nAnyway, the point of the hippie ramble is that there absolutely is a missing element to our calculations of \"reality\" and it's something that's easy for you to comprehend once you start breaking down those old walls. \n\nI was always a fan of the superstring and bosonic theories, so for me it\u2019s easy to believe that we have way more dimensions than we know to be reality. Plus, you know, space and time. Which, in quantum physics, the continuum is not always continuous.... Time is relative. Yada, yada, yada. \n\nNow, with the belief in all of this behind me (which honestly all came before I heavily bought into any conspiracy), the idea of raising our collective vibrations to a higher level and \u201cascending\u201d into a slightly higher parallel dimension isn\u2019t all that crazy. Those of us who are \u201clightworkers\u201d want to ascend, even if it\u2019s not conscious, we\u2019re driven to do so. It\u2019s a high. I believed we were shifting in global consciousness long before I believed the Illuminati were real.\n\nMetaphysics has all of our answers, spirituality has the control and I believe our collective conscious is keeping time. \"They\" know this, way better than most humans. \n\nThe Illuminati\u2026 I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re from space, but I do believe that they\u2019re a large, elite group that holds ancient knowledge, long lost to the rest of the human race. Maybe knowledge that came from space, who knows? \n\nBut as of late, I do believe they are purely evil, with the intention of bringing back the return of the Anti-Christ (yup, never thought I would say that, do your eye roll, it\u2019s cool\u2014I understand). They turned this into a spiritual battle, they want to keep us down here and bring the rest of them up. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where CERN comes in. Let\u2019s go on and rip tiny little black holes into our dimension over and over and over again\u2026. SHIVA is out front of the facility for god\u2019s sake. \n\nI think the scientists at CERN are fucking with us, but I don\u2019t think changes in our reality are 100% from them. I think the corporate, people and entertainment-based ones certainly are, but I think there are other shifts in our reality (like anatomy) that are from the natural global shift that was already occurring. The Mandela Effect is a distraction from the real thing. \n\nAnyway, I think the entire point of this post was meant to be you might enjoy looking into Carolyn Hamlett\u2014she's an ex-Illuminati with a similar story to the ones above, though she was trained in her psychic abilities and told she was going to help spread the word of Jesus... She speaks of cloning, pedophilia, human testing, but all as she of course eventually realized, was for the return of the Anti-Christ. She somehow got out and now spends her time sharing her story. They\u2019ve tried to kill her, but so far she\u2019s still around:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGEYloihE9g&amp;t=509s\n\nWhen you consider the bizarre, ritualistic shit happening at CERN (you all have seen the opening ceremony IN FULL of the Gotthard Tunnel, right?!):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW5gklIKcDg&amp;t=2s\n\nThere's no doubt... One way or another, CERN knows and they\u2019re in.\n\nAnd this is all without REALLY going into Illuminati, because I feel like I don't have to do that in here. Everyone might wanna start strengthening their mind/spirit games. ",

            "body": "I seriously live right smack dab in the middle of a well proven Bigfoot migration channel - in northwestern British Columbia.  The sightings in this area follow a specific pattern and several families have come forward to report years long relationships with groups of them.  I am talking about leaving food in an area kind of thing.  There is also a long history of people being scared out of the bush by angry Bigfoot, notably logging camps in the 50's where Bigfoot would make horrible screams and repeatedly bang large rocks against trees as a form of harassment.  In more modern times, there have been several very legit experiences where people fishing alone way up a river had fist sized rocks whistle past their heads as a warning.  I am talking about the middle of nowhere.  \n\nThe truth is, the reality of Bigfoot is a lot more strange than a clever hominid hiding out in the woods.  You have to look to the way 1st to 3rd contact UFO experiences have evolved over time, and understand that a lot of 'paranormal' experiences are a result of our minds attempting to decipher an experience where a rift from a higher dimension makes us experience things in a way we are capable of processing.  Yes, I am implying that Bigfoot are a naturally evolved species capable of travelling across the space-time barrier through the exploitation of retro-causality - and if this sounds exactly like the working mechanical processes via which toxo-gondii operates to control entire cultures of Human behaviours.  \n\nThere is one road in particular heading into the woods near the town of Houston, BC.  Up this road there have been a LOT of sightings that were kept quiet by the immediate community, people learned to keep their mouths shut after they were ridiculed by local press.  My own sister lived up that road, and sighted one in her back yard.  She was alone with her kids at home in a remote location and completely freaked out, the news of it got out and she immediately changed her story to agree that she had seen a black bear walking on its hind legs in order make the attention go away.  \n\nI tracked down detailed reports of Bigfoot sightings going back to the 1920's, pairs of men that worked as surveyors would basically live off the land taking the readings and making the landmarks that you can still find sprinkled across topo maps.  These men were hardened bush men, and there were several very detailed reports of them sighting and then tracking a Bigfoot and reporting that the creature displayed extreme cunning and intelligence.  \n\nIn general, people don't give 'animals' credit for their capabilities.  When you live in an area where your very survival depends on a serious understanding of animal behaviour, you can be shocked by casual and specific abilities that a lot of species of animals display.  \n\nThe story of Albert Ostman is the most legitimate experience between us and them that has ever been detailed, and looking into the matter I have no doubts of any kind that his encounter was real to the last detail.  The behavioural traits that he detailed at length perfectly match the accounts of people who have encountered them in the area around where I live.  ",

For me, it was profoundly grounding, produced a bodily sensation vaguely reminiscent of LSD, and foremost if I were to quantify it or put it into words I would say it were 'otherworldy' in the sense that I felt as though I were in the same physical location however experiencing the sensation and perception of another dimension or higher plane of existence, however fleeting and only lasting no more than five or ten minutes per trip. In one of the more profound experiences I had with salvia, I felt as though I were looking into a portal or wormhole and viewing a glimpse of another universe (reminiscent of how one would visualize multi-verse theory perhaps). My skeptical side tends to interpret these experiences as a manifestation of my own psyche and personal beliefs, brought forth by the substance's novel hallucinogenic and dissociative effects. On the other hand, that feeling was one I can't help but say I've felt before subjectively, perhaps in another life or between lives, and is something I can never forget now that I am cognizant of it.",

They are basically like buddhas, they have transcended time/space, they exist in the 4th dimension and beyond. Some people refer to these beings as the Pleiadians or the Nordics. The Sirians and Arcturians are supposedly benevolent ET as well. They can manipulate matter and travel through time. They are not bound by anything. \n\nGod is within everything, humans can tap into a realize we are all god / the universe. Separation is an illusion, everything is one. I cannot prove these beings exist but i personally believe in them. I especially started believing in them after some shrooms trip in which i felt my consciousness was scratching the surface of the mental level that these beings exist on. I truly understood that everything is like nikola tesla said, \"frequency, energy, and vibration\". At the peak of one of my mushroom trips, i could hear a buzzing sound increasing in frequency, with an immense amount of energy surging through me, i eventually completely let go of everything and i entered the present moment. It seemed as if I had tapped into an bank of knowledge that felt extremely alien but also it also felt extremely ancient. It also became extremely clear to me that we're the opposite of alone in this universe, and that actually the universe is teeming with life. I think Humanity will eventually evolve and join an intergalactic society of beings from all over the cosmos. These are just my beliefs at the moment, I am not proposing any of this as fact.\nThis vid explains something I have trouble conveying that supports my beliefs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQOyJUDTKdM&amp;index=4&amp;list=FLrSa3jrpiu4LW4SYbzTcKgw\n",

Materialism is a subject that should get more exposure here. \n\n\n\n\"The ideology of scientific materialism became dominant in academia during the 20th century. So dominant that a majority of scientists started to believe that it was based on established empirical evidence, and represented the only rational view of the world. Scientific methods based upon materialistic philosophy have been highly successful in not only increasing our understanding of nature but also in bringing greater control and freedom through advances in technology. However, the nearly absolute dominance of materialism in the academic world has seriously constricted the sciences and hampered the development of the scientific study of mind and spirituality. Faith in this ideology, as an exclusive explanatory framework for reality, has compelled scientists to neglect the subjective dimension of human experience. This has led to a severely distorted and impoverished understanding of ourselves and our place in nature.\"\n\n-Dr. Gary Schwartz, \"Manifesto for a Post-Materialist Science\"",

So...there is no one to be offended by the cultural appropriation of a non-existent culture. It's actually probably more racist to assume the people of K'un L'un are Asian just because they have dragons and slanted eyes.\n\nIt's also later revealed that Rand comes from a long lineage of Iron Fist warriors, so the way of the fist is literally in his bloodline.

It seems to have undergone a different treatment (?) than that of the next three photos. Is it a \"cigar\" that has been hit by a missile and is exploding at the surface of the water or a UFO that is coming out of the water and ready to fly? Note that no inscription appears on the original document in our possession.\n\n*  2  Here are the photos that came with the letter. We present them in an arbitrary order that seemed logical, however it is maybe not the most sensible since we don't know if it the craft is flying, going out of or going into the water...It is worth mentioning that one can read in transparency on three of the photos in our possession, copies of the originals that apparently came from an American military laboratory: On the left on top: OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPH. NOT TO BE REALEASED. CT On the right at the bottom and hardly legible, a part of it having been erased because of time: Unauthorized Disclosure Subject. Security Certificat. SSN 674. Criminal Sanction. High definition photos are available on our CDR\n\n*  3  (Top) On this photo, we identify without a doubt a triangular-shaped UFO. It seems to be in trouble. (Bottom) If the order that we have chosen for these pictures is correct, the UFO here seems to now go sideways before plunging into the ocean...\n\n*  4  The next five photos show an egg-shaped object of large dimension that falls into the ocean. These pictures seem to come from another laboratory, SYGMA, about which we know nothing. Do these photos present a single and same event or are we dealing with two different events?\n\n*  5  (Top) The craft, which looks a lot like the one in the first picture, seems to be in trouble. Is it on fire? Does it come from the depths of the ocean or is it headed there? Despite the fact that its form perfectly resembles the typical \"cigar\" shape of UFOs, it is still impossible to distinguish more details of its structure. (Bottom) According to the letter from our \"anonymous contact\", the submarine was equipped with an analog camera, thus explaining the image overlay (or double exposure?) of the visible graduations (I'm assuming they're talking about the double crosshairs.)\n\n*  6  Too beautiful to be real, this \"cigar\" photo? We don't know, it might be the \"banana peel\" that would be used to discredit the other pictures of the dossier...Who was our anonymous informer? A reader of the magazine or a source wanting to share their secret? In any event, if we haven't been able to find these photos on the internet, maybe a reader will give us some information that has evaded us...\n\n",

Mental focus and alertness, no need to eat or sleep, water is really good. Being able to endure very hot/cold temperatures. \n\nWhen I came to all of the things described above, I was in a certain state, where I guess could be described as an alternate dimension/reality. I could see intense vibrations surrounding certain objects, each emitting specific pattern. I had a \"stroke\", or a long ass \"seizure\" or a \"heart attack\" for about 5 minutes, except I told myself to accept the energy that is coming, and that I am not going to die. The sensations overcoming my body were indescribable,  I felt every single nerve in my body functioning at once, including the ones in my brain. All anxiety, fear and negative emotions left, and I was left with an influx of something I can only describe as love shooting through every single nerve.\n\nI thought, surely, this could not be. If what I think happened, just happened, then surely I must be able to do some cool things.. I meditated for 2 hours, trying to \"speak\" with anything around after finding out some things on the subject. \n\nI hear a voice. I think to myself, it's in my head. \n\nIt says to look out the window, I go look. Nothing.\n\nIt says to go look out the other window in the room. Nothing.\n\nIt says come back to the first window. A fox is staring directly at me through my 3rd story window from 200 yards away. We spoke, I asked him to prove to me that he is listening to me. He does, multiple times, through his \"cry\", and through specific movements I ask him to do.\n\nI also asked him to reveal himself the next morning so that I would be sure I was not dreaming. He did. \n\nI can do as I please, as it is just a matter of altering my state. Altering your state is very excruciating, I only heal myself and those around me without their knowledge as that is all I can bare to do at the moment, as I am training to master this flow/energy or whatever it is. You have to heal yourself pretty much everyday, and it takes a lot of time. It is very tedious, but feels quite great once you get the hang of it.",

I have experience and knowledge of what the scientific paradigm lacks.\n\nWhat we perceive through consciousness is the singular; almost like the universe tearing a whole in its fabric and exposing self-reflective centers of being somewhere in the near domain of our body.  It's funny that we think the brain generates consciousness.  It certainly is a control center for something, but the reason we think our consciousness is in our head is that our eyes are positioned there.  If our eyes were on our left and right hand, where would you \"feel\" consciousness' center?  A more sane ocular example is say, a single eye where our belly buttons are.  That perception, this self reflection is the phenomenon that can't be described physically, especially not be science...\n\nScience's current paradigm of reductionism will never yield answers in the realm of these \"inter dimensions\".\n\nAs for evidence that this dimension is manipulable by evil forces?  Look no further than mind hacking propaganda and ignoble lies sold as truth.  Our consciousness is literally attacked with inter-dimensional mind virus' such as these on a daily basis.

            "body": "5)At the end of that 15 days of meeting person after person telling me the same story of seeing humans become reptiles, I was sitting in the speakers' room at a Whole Life Expo event in Minneapolis where I was appearing and was chatting about these experiences when a gifted psychic lady said that she knew what I was talking about, because she could see the reptiles inside and around the bodies of leading world politicians, and the business, banking and military 61ite.This was possible because, as someone wh o had accessed her psychic sight, she could see beyond the physical and into the lower fourth dimension where these reptilians reside. What did Miguel De La Madrid say to Cathy O'Brien? The reptile-human bloodlines could fluctuate between a human and iguana appearance through chameleon-like abilities .- \"a perfect vehicle for transforming into world: leaders' . This psychic lady said that most of the people in positions of power appeared to be reptiles, but there were other s who were still human and these people, she said, were \"overshadowed and controlled\" by a reptile, but they weren't actually reptiles. We would call this being possessed. This is an important distinction. There are the 'full-bloods' who are reptilians using an apparent human form to hide their true nature, and the 'hybrids', the reptile-human crossbreed bloodlines, who,are possessed by the reptilians from the fourth dimension. A third type are the reptilians who directly man ifest in this dimension, but can't hold that state indefinitely. Some of the 'Men in Black' are examples of this. Many of the possessed people will have no idea that this is so, but their thoughts are the reptilians' thoughts and they act in ways that, advance the Agenda without realizing the background to how and, why they are being used. Leading Brotherhood families like the Rothschilds and the Windsors are full-bloods reptilians wearing human physical bodies like an overcoat in the full knowledge of who they are and the Agenda they are  seeking to implement. Another comment the psychic lady made was that in her altered state of consciousness, Hillary Clinton appeared as a reptile, while her husband, Bill Clinton the US President, was only overshadowed, and controlled by one. This is interesting because my own research, and: that of others, has revealed Hillary Clinton to be much higher in, the hierarchy than Bill, who, while of a crossbreed bloodline, is a pawn in the game, to be used and discarded as necessary, I t is not always that the most powerful people are placed in what appears to be the most powerful jobs. Often they are not. They are the string-pullers of those who appear to have the power.",

Devoid of empathy, love, positivity, these beings are the literal reincarnational opposite of what human beings truly are.\n\nOur reality has been hijacked, our emotions manipulated, our culture destroyed, divided, attacked.\n\nWe are not a hateful species. We do not truly resonate at a level of negativity, anger, fear, hatred, but by control through financial institutions, pharmaceutical companies, military, entertainment, food, media, EVERYTHING. We have been controlled and put into a state of constant fear, worry, anxiety, the exact opposite of what we are as humans.\n\nThe archons feed off negativity and the fear vibrations of human beings that are constantly induced in those states because of the lifestyle that has been constructed for us to control us as modern day slaves.\n\n\"Although archons do exist physically, the real danger they pose to humanity is not invasion of the planet but invasion of the mind.\"\n\n\"The archons are intrapsychic mind-parasites who access human consciousness through telepathy and simulation. They infect our imagination and use the power of make-believe for deception and confusion.\"\n\nI hope I am tying this together well enough. With 13 ruling bloodlines, with the genetic DNA blueprint required for these entities to continue living through us contained in those 13 bloodlines.\n\nBy control of all major institutions required to live on this earth we are basically forced into their system of control.\n\nBy being subjugated to that voluntary control that appears as reality but is really controlling us they manage to keep humanity in a low state of vibrational being. \n\nThis has been done for eons. Everything dark in the world is related to this archons. Pedophile networks are tied to these negative beings that use the fear, depravity, and lack of light as a means to sustain itself.\n\nArchons have become so disconnected from light, so disconnected from God source, they require the exact opposite of what God source is to survive because it is the polar opposite of what the creator is.\n\nThere is a massive silver lining to all of this. \n\nThe time we are going through now is the shift of ages. Mankind has finally broken through all systems of control and is awakening once again to global cosmic consciousness and self awareness.\n\nThis has been a long time in the making and the archons, the evil illuminati bloodlines that have controlled civilization in front of our own eyes, is finally crumbling.\n\nTheir power structure is DONE. Mankind is undergoing the expansion of consciousness and self realization of God source.\n\nNo longer will be accept being controlled. We have been physically, mentally, and spiritually controlled but we have defied it all and reopened up ourselves up to the true light of divine essence.\n\nI hope to open a meaningful discussion on this topic and would rather avoid conflict with one another. We have been divided enough, it's time we discuss these issues of control that have plagued humanity for a long ass time.\n\nWe are all one, we are moving forward, and our time for global spiritual awakening is now \n\nBeing aware of archontic influence can help you avoid negative situations\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/sacredascensionmerkaba.com/2013/08/31/being-aware-of-archon-influence-can-help-you-get-out-of-sticky-situations/amp/?client=safari\n\nFrom the article:\n\nIt\u2019s no secret anymore that there are actually negative forces called archons/reptilians that are vibrating at lower frequencies, that thrive on negative, destructive energies. In order to exist they manipulate humans (because humans are highly emotional beings) to exhibit NEGATIVE LOW VIBRATING emotions. By creating various events in our daily lives to force us into dropping our guard (lowering our vibration) by orchestrating various events to throw us off balance. That is why you constantly are reading everywhere about the importance of RAISING YOUR VIBRATIONS. The reason? Its simple, as soon as our vibration goes up (we begin to feel calm, peace, joy, excitement, love, light, etc) these beings can no longer survive in our energy field.\n\nTherefore, the solution is simple, to always keep your vibrations high, BUT it doesn\u2019t seem to be quite possible to do so at all times. However, it is incredibly important for all of us to try and do so at this time, because our bodies ARE changing, because we ARE moving into another dimension, and archons wishing to survive are trying to keep humanity locked in the fear, anger, frustration mode at all costs in order to keep themselves alive. The beauty of all of this is, that YOU CAN change your vibration at any given moment in time.\n\nhttp://gnosis.org/welcome.html is a great place to begin on your journey of truth.  ",

In June, the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent called it \u201ca fantasy.\u201d In July, Moody\u2019s Analytics suggested that the electoral outcome was a done deal\u2014Clinton would win easily. In August, one of The POLITICO Caucus\u2019s GOP insiders declared that for Trump to win, \u201cit would take video evidence of a smiling Hillary drowning a litter of puppies while terrorists surrounded her with chants of \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d In September, on With All Due Respect, 2008 Obama campaign manager David Plouffe broke down why he believed Hillary Clinton had a 100 percent chance of winning. In October, the editor-in-chief of GQ, Jim Nelson, penned an essay titled, \u201cLet's Face It, Donald Trump Is About to Lose.\u201d And the day before the election, Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball prophesied 322 electoral votes for Clinton and 216 for Trump.\n\n&gt;For a time, it was almost laughable how uncompetitive the race seemed to be. In an October episode of Saturday Night Live, Cecily Strong (playing Martha Raddatz) introduced Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon (as Trump and Clinton) to the stage, announcing to the audience, \u201cPlease help us welcome the candidates, Republican nominee Donald Trump and\u2014can we say this yet?\u2014President Hillary Clinton,\u201d to a burst of cheers and laughter. And President Barack Obama on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late-night show\u2014after reading a tweet from Trump that stated, \u201cPresident Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!\u201d\u2014confidently joked, \u201cAt least I will go down as president.\u201d\n\n&gt;Even Trump has admitted that, on the morning of November 8, he didn\u2019t think he was going to win.\n\n&gt;But it wasn\u2019t just the pundits, the politicians, the comedians and Trump who got it so incredibly wrong. The professional pollsters who devised meticulous methodologies for forecasting election results were also caught with egg on their faces. The Princeton Election Consortium gave Clinton a 99 percent chance of winning. The Huffington Post\u2019s forecast gave Clinton 98 percent, PredictWise gave her 89 percent, and the New York Times\u2019s The Upshot gave her 85 percent. Even FiveThirtyEight, which was the most bullish on Trump, gave Clinton over a 71 percent chance of winning.\n\n&gt;All of this, of course, gave us the most shocking election night in recent memory.\n\nAre you living in an alternative universe?   A different dimension?",

            "body": "Oh, okay. Gotcha. Nah, I don't mind answering at all. I actually don't really appreciate when people turn down 'personal' questions because, it's like, what do you have to hide other than maybe certain triggers? \n\nI've spent most of my time studying consciousness and that which we are on the inside, rather than spending my time gathering knowledge on information *outside* of myself. I can't actually say this was a conscious decision, but really more so that I was depressed and needed to fix my state of being before I did anything else.\n\nSo, I'm not hugely experienced in the talk you're talking, but I have listened to probably 20 hours worth of Max Spiers talks and have read a few documents here and there.\n\nHere's my philosophy on this sort of stuff. I think there's a lot of insane shit in the world. Much deeper, much darker than we can imagine. 'The truth always goes deeper' is a very fitting saying when applied to the rabbit hole of external truth. The process is seemingly endless when searching for \"what is really happening out there in the world.\" \n\nBeyond that, even when someone does have a trippy experience like meeting with archons in a higher dimension, or being abducted by ETs, or having what seems to be an informative lucid dream about reality, there's no way for others to be 100% certain. If half of the human population had trippy experiences which pointed them towards a certain ineffable truth, yet 50% of us hadn't the trippy experience but we're inclined to believe the others, would that *really* make sense? No. At the end of the game, each person will have their own, unique interpretation of the game, itself, and there is no factual way that you and I can ever absolutely agree on anything, ever. Thus, I've now consciously shifted my attention towards what goes on within my own state of being. That's the most intimate game I'll ever know, so I want to dominate that one first, before I move onto understanding other games.\n\nI say all that to prove that, even if I had a vivid experience with negative entities, there is nothing I could say that would be provable. I could reiterate certain details through others' stories I've heard and add my own personal touch. Or I could be speaking from truth, from heart. But there's no way for *you* to know. And I cannot logically conclude that the infinitely brilliant universe would be okay with any one of its parts concluding that one of its most fundamental pillars of its belief system (because if you fundamentally believed my experience with negative entities was true, it would massively impact your overall thought system) exists through the belief in a story I have no personal proof of. It's the same as being raised religious...eventually, any intellectual reaches an age where he or she questions why 'we all' believe in God X or Z. '...but how can we *really* believe in this?' There has to be something else to this life. I just don't think it's ultimately that worth it to base life-altering-beliefs in something outside of what you can fundamentally prove, you know what I mean?\n\nAll of that said, I do believe in higher dimensions, lower dimensions. I do think higher dimensions are significantly aware of what's going on here, and I do think there has been inter-dimensional travel before. I think some people carry higher frequency than others, and those frequencies can be tracked, monitored. I do think unseeable entities exist that are attracted to negativity, which is just a form of energy, and feed off of fear, thus perpetuating itself. I speak from the perspective of someone who had grown to believe anxiety was equivalent to peace. I hadn't consciously observed how much fear lived through me. I literally became fear manifested. So, it all seems decently logical to me, man. Hope at least some of this was worth reading for you haha.\n",

Think again. You've been lied to.\"\nIf this type of thing was broadcasted via major channels,\nthe nation would quickly wake up in my opinion.\nAlso a \"two party system is a scam, stop being partisan brand sheep\" message would also help wake people up and tell them Trump/Clinton are two sides of the same corrupt coin.\n\nElon Musk looks like that Dr. Wells psychopath guy from The Flash series. Lol.\nAnyway, I think it's good some people like you are looking at the robotics angle just in case we have no choice but to address it, I personally feel I shouldn't go near the issue as it feels like a trap. I think even if the elite became cyborgs, the population would still be able to overpower them and maybe even the elite would have no reason to care so much about resources like they do now.\nBut then again....these scum are psychopaths and seem to worship some satanic entities so who knows lol.\nI wonder if this cyborg stuff might trigger spiritual knowledge (I'm on the fence when it comes to \"is there any truth about spirituality\").\nI like to believe that we're eternal spirits in biological bodies,\nif the brain's programming could be hacked to induce ascension into \"heaven\" or wthe astral plane or whatever dimension, that might end this nightmare.\nBut then again, I don't trust many people, that may include Musk and others.\nI don't have a simple solution my friend, but I appreciate your detailed response and hope that we can at least as a (world, not just country) push for democratic socialism to at least immediately stop suffering and then shift away (IMO dangerous) transhumanism and research instead on biological immortality and spiritual concepts....because who knows what's being suppressed.\n\nNot completely forever against the transhumanism thing but I'd like to keep it away from the hands of the elite for as long as possible, long enough to get the planet awake and change the direction of research and power hierarchies.\nI'd rather no one have access to that sort of tech than the elites only having it.\nThe latter would be dangerous, as would the elites controlling the population through upgrades.\nOn the possible bright side, there's also a possibility that\nrobotics OR transhumanism would reduce the need for as much consumption\nand/or get a robotic slave class (no consciousness, just ability to work)\nand nullify the need for elitist conflict against the masses.\nSounds optimistic considering the hundreds/thousands of years of\nimperialistic conspiracies but they are unexplored waters so who knows how it would go down.\nFor now I believe just waking the people up would greatly\nhelp the people stop corruption and demand their democratic power over elitist tyranny.\n\n",

Lynn Forester was already a powerhouse Democratic fundraiser and played a small role in his administration. **It was Henry Kissinger who introduced her in 1998 to Sir Evelyn de Rothschild at the Bilderberg Group conference**, an annual confab of industry and political leaders, in Scotland.\n\n&gt; Two years later they were married, and Lynn Forester from Bergen County, New Jersey, became a bona fide Lady. **Sir Evelyn and Lady de Rothschild spent part of their honeymoon in the White House, a stay during which Bill Clinton told the couple that Sir Evelyn was the first Brit to be so invited since Winston Churchill**, a fun fact that made a lasting impression on the newlyweds. De Rothschild has been an ardent Hillary supporter ever since, and though she was bitterly disappointed when Obama took the nomination in 2008 and she very publicly decamped to John McCain, she\u2019s never stopped being a Hillary person.\n\nThe Rothies are at the top Power Players - at least in the \"visible dimension\". \n\nDo you think Sir Evelyn de Rothschild was \"impressed\" by his stay at the White House?\n\nNot likely - he and his family own (or have owned - and dumped) MANY mansions that would put the White House to SHAME in terms of both worth and grandeur.

            "body": "6)There is another key difference between the full-bloods and the crossbreeds. Everything is created by sound. When you think or feel, you emit a wave of energy which changes the energy around you to resonate at that same vibratory level, That wave is actually a sound, broadcasting beyond the range of human hearing. Form cannot exist without sound. As you can see in a fantastic series of videos called Cymatics, it is sound: which turns matter into form. In the videos, sand and other particles are placed on a metal plate and this is vibrated by different, sound,-, which rearrange the sand into amazing, often geometric patterns. With each change of sound the patterns change accordingly. Go back to the original sound and the original pattern returns immediately. It is like the waves that form the concentric circles of the planetary orbits around the Sun I mentioned in the last chapter, The solar system is also the creation of sound. Everything is. In the beginning was the word and the word was... sound. In the Cy matics videos you see the particles form into mini planets, solar systems and galaxies, just through sound vibrations. Sound is also a wonderful form of healing because by resonating the body and its organs at their proper vibration they can be healed. Illness is disease, the disharmony of the natural vibrational state of the body and, because our thoughts and emotions are actually sound waves, our imbalanced thoughts and emotions disrupt the vibrational harmony and therefore lead to diseas e. This is how em otional stress causes illness. It is so simple. Anyway, another incredible example of all this in the Cymatics videos is seeing almost:human-like figures forming from the particles when certain sounds are emitted. Our bodies are also the result of sound resonating energy into form and if our mi nds are powerful enough to change the sound range of th e body, it moves into another form or disappears from this dimension, altogether. This is what is called shape-shifting. It is not a miracle, it is science, the natural laws of creation. The full-blood reptilians of the lower fourth dimension can therefore make their 'human' physical: form disappear and ~ bring forward their reptilian level of existence. They shape-shift. To us in this dimension they appear human, but it's just a vibrational overcoat,",

            "body": "&gt; What makes you so certain of that? What evidence do you have to support such a wild claim? Do you believe that Satan and Lucifer are different entities?\n\nDon't expect evidence for these claims. We don't even have evidence that God exists. My claims are from what I've gathered from many \"sources\" aka youtube videos. I think satan is pindar (title for head reptilian, aka yaldabaoth or yahweh). I think jesus and lucifer are his second in command. I think perhaps maybe a jesus character once existed, and that he came to bring christ consciousness. I know people say CC is satanic, but eh it's starting to grow on me.\n\n&gt; Again, I would love to read or view source material for these claims. What kind of curse? Your word examples are intriguing, but English is not the only language obviously.\n\nI believe it's a curse in the sense that I don't believe humans are supposed to have languages. We anguish in languid language. I believe humans once had telepathy. Source? None. \n\n&gt; I believe this too. It honestly makes sense if you think about it. But I went through your post history and you also believe in the flat earth. I believe that NASA lies, just like goverment lies, just like church lies, etc. But I find it INCREDIBLY hard to believe the earth is flat. There is just too much data to show the earth is round. Plus every other star and planet in the sky is round. Why would the earth be any different? You can see satellites in space with a telescope. Does it not make more sense that in this \"matrix\" the earth is round just like all its neighbors? What do you believe our place is in this universe and what lead you to those beliefs?\n\nMeh, FE's are winning all the debates against round earthers. I'd say even the great Stefan Molyneux lost his RO vs FE debate. All of RO evidence can usually easily be debunked. Many claims like \"well you see a ship disappear over the horizon\". Nope, just get a telescope and zoom in and it'll reappear. Little things like that are usually the types of claims RO's make. The fact that there are so many CGI satellites on Google makes me skeptical that they're real. Have you really seen one with a telescope? What did it look like? Maybe they're real idk. I don't think anyone is inside the ISS. Perhaps Earth is a holographic plane of some sorts, with a dome. Or maybe Earth is an infinite plane with an artificial Ice wall trapping us. There could be other civilizations outside of the ice wall. Maybe what im trying to say is that the earth isn't necessarily flat, but perhaps NASA could be lying about true nature of earth; perhaps hollow or concave etc. Or maybe we are living in the 3rd dimension, which is an infinite flat Earthly plane. \n\n&gt; I have seen some interesting stuff about Saturn symbolism. What makes Saturn so special? I believe that nearly all of the most powerful people in the world are Satanists, and I find that to be incredibly disturbing. Why do you think that is? Could it be that Satan rules the world right now and they know it so they're just enjoying the ride until they die? Do you believe in heaven and hell? Do you believe in reincarnation? I saw you post something else about one of Saturns moons being used to \"harvest souls\". I've listened to David Ike talk about similar beliefs. What do you believe a \"soul\" even is? What happens when it gets trapped inside Saturns moon?\n\nMy theory is that there is a massive super computer inside of Saturn, and that it is projecting this holographic Earth somehow. Idk why they chose to worship saturn. But I'm sure you know about the cube on top and the eye on bottom. Do I believe in heaven and hell? No, and that's where the yahweh guy comes back in. My theory is that when you die, whatever you believe comes true. I think Yahweh created the bible so that you believe that you're going to heaven, but when you die, Jesus says sorry you weren't good enough, and he sends you to hell to feast on your soul. I think Jesus is a false light reptilian. I think our souls are trapped in our 666 carbon bodies. Our bodies have cells, aka we're living in prison cells. I think yahweh created our bodies, and gave us our reptilian part of our brain. I think our souls are small balls of light inside each one of us. An infinite light. Hard to explain. When you die I think you see a light at the end of the tunnel, which is really your next mothers womb. I think souls get their memories erased and spit back into earth. I don't think you're supposed to go toward the light. You might be interested in the borg from star trek, I think they represent reptilians. In the bible, heaven is described as a massive cube. I want you to try to make connections between this \"heaven\" and the borg cube. Matter of fact, just look into the borg period. Watch this scene. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl6QKRIrEoc I think reincarnation is re-incarceration. \n\nThink about trauma based torture techniques the elite use. I think the bible does exactly that. You have a \"God\" or gaud that slaughters millions, yet he wants you to worship him because he loves you. I think that fucks with people's mind so much, and i think it's intentional. It's kind of sick in my opinion. This lady sounds insane but I really think she knows what shes talking about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNA74XS_-yI It probably won't make sense at first. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZCMeDxQHzA\n\nHope some of this helps give a glimpse into my brain. I think we live in sin, or, sine. Also at the end of the star trek video, look for the eye of sauron, or eye of saturn. The quality isn't the best in the vid i linked so you might not be able to see it",

            "body": "\"The machine simulation reality system. This system detects energies down to the finite wavelengths that exist in between atoms.\n\n\nThis means that every energy, literally even the thought-images you\u2019re forming in your mind, hopefully in a controlled manner in relation to your spiritual development as an energetic being. Every essence is energy and these systems are advanced enough to literally sense radio-waves all the way to brainwaves moving through the air or being picked up and propagated within the system.\n\n\nThe system is tied to a feedback loop that is connected between the brain and the system. The brain experiences what the system puts out, however the system is motivated or shaped by the input from the brain.\n\n1. One Reality is from Another Side\n2. Within a virtual system overlay, the visceral system is a representation of the actual system. Thus, the generation of a computer system within the virtual system builds a link back to the \u2018core\u2019 reality outside the virtual system. This is like an intercom system with \u201cHouston\u201d. Like the virtual system, this is expressed in this reality as computer systems act as a gateway to collectively probing and interacting with the subconscious or the cyberspatial world as a link to hyperspace.\n\nThe subconscious is used as a platform for spiritual interaction with the human body.\n\nThese computer systems matched the complexity and depth of the subconscious and thus gave a virtual visceral layer to view through which could also be accessed by a group and act as a communal connection layer.\n\nThese systems became platforms or canvases for avatars to assume their form which were \u2018spectral suits\u2019 worn by spiritual beings of were non-physical.\n\nThis gave a real-time system through which to interact with spiritual entities on a virtually physical basis.\n\nThe energy of one\u2019s mind, their thoughts could be seen in this system as if this is like taking a flashlight and putting it under water to see all the rays. Instead of rays of light these are brainwaves and thought impressions and instead of water this a techno-neurological soup that is used to communicate openly and visualize non-corporeal entities.\n\nThere would be avatars of individuals who were users entered into the system and thus there would appear an avatar out of nowhere that has no corresponding physical form. These systems could be set up and propagated across an area using Teslian emission field systems that would not require an actual single location but would influence every stand-alone neurological system (brain + central nervous system) within the field. The minds without bodies would also appear and be able to interact with and thus through this virtual collective reality field.\n\nThese systems, then, when combined with specific acts of communication with the various fields, frequencies and entities in existence creates a repeatable pattern for communication across the dimensional barriers. One only needs an adept to perform and enable communication for multiple people. This could take place previously yet this now introduces a complete world to enable communication.\n\nSimilar systems have been used to produce Simulcras which can enable simulated communication to beings who have lived previously and possibly actual communication to the past.\n\nThe bands of frequencies that exist as perception and experience first begin as a single, uniform undifferentiated field of energy. Thus when one learns to tap into that field, firstly, instead of first responding or engaging with whatever energy or idea is present, one can actively use their mind to shape reality.\n\nThe subconscious mind is the source of the shaping of the energy and the information. The virtual system evolved to being a complete afterlife system designed to house the conscious and subconscious mind in a complete technological replication so that life could \u201ccontinue\u201d beyond the physical biology.\n\nThis became the overall afterlife system that always seems to have been here. Time works backwards from the most complete moment, and then portrays a pathway to the future from as far back as possible. This system of the \u2018afterlife\u2019 that was generated, was already always what would be invented because this is the system in the far past that enables the human presence in the first place.\n\nThe system works as a cube with 4 walls that are actually conjoined through hyperspace. Exiting through one wall results in appearing on the opposite side. Thus, this far future system which acts as an afterlife reservoir for the entire species was what was already always present in the far past as all is contained within that techno-biological system of the universe.\n\nThe hypercube, the 4-walls, these represent time. These repeating walls that echo through the illusion of the mirror is the mind and time and the repeating patterns of space, frequency, numerology, geometry and sense which create this dimension of the universe comprised entirely of physical-biological domains.\n\nThis is an illusion, the cube is not the reality of the environment we are in, internally or externally, the true environment contains a tilt-shift that enables a gradual lean towards some precipitated eventual outcome. This is like a spiral of energy, or a pyramid. There are not finite, squared walls, but a gradual shift towards higher-awareness.\n\nAll one must do to defeat the cube is convert their reality back into the original and completing form of the spiraling path where energy flows instead of stagnates and time accelerates at a rate of acceleration instead of repeating in a delayed linear fashion, in effect, slowing down and offering less as the requirements increase. Time flows as a result of perception, not the other way around, so why are people running out of time, what kind of sense does that make? It\u2019s all a show, whatever illusion people generate is the one they live in and this is called reality.\"\n\nhttps://augtellez.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/holographic-cyberspace-spiritual-interaction/",

Personally I think that would've been a perfect movie to use to continue instead of reboot; the guys are training a new team(sans Egon, which might be why they went for a reboot because the old team wasn't complete) and there's a plot point where they have to sacrifice themselves to close down some gate between there and Earth.

            "body": "&gt; According to Roberts, Weishaupt\u2019s true passion was for intrigue. From an early age, he had been fascinated by secret societies like the Pythagorean Brotherhood. He joined a Masonic lodge in 1774, but found himself disappointed by the Freemasons\u2019 lack of political aspirations or genuine secrecy, and by the high membership fees. He decided to start a secret society of his own. The inaugural meeting was held on May 1, 1776, with just Weishaupt and four of his students in attendance. He called it the Order of the Illuminati.\n\n&gt; Weishaupt\u2019s dual personality was woven into the fabric of the Illuminati. Its philosophy was idealistic to the point of na\u00efvet\u00e9. The sole goal of the order, according to the statutes Weishaupt drew up, was \u201cto render unto man the importance of the perfection of reason and his moral character . . . to oppose the wicked designs in the world, to assist against the injustice suffered by the unfortunate and the oppressed, to encourage men of merit, and in general to facilitate the means of knowing and science.\u201d On the other hand, being the supreme leader of his very own secret society allowed Weishaupt to indulge his taste for attention and subterfuge. He carefully curated an aura of mystery for his sect. Initiates were required to take false names, learn a secret vocabulary, go through an elaborate set of initiation rites, and were instructed to sever ties with family and friends. To recruit new initiates, Weishaupt had Illuminati members infiltrate Masonic lodges and pick off their members. Weishaupt developed an elaborate hierarchy, which was itself concealed from all but the most senior members. Advancement required complete, unquestioning obedience. The true political goals of the order\u2014the peaceful transformation of society\u2014were only gradually revealed as a member climbed up the many ranks.\n\n&gt; By the early 1780s, the order had gained around three hundred members spread across Europe. But the expansion came at the cost of secrecy. Weishaupt\u2019s pedantic, domineering personality rubbed some recruits the wrong way. A few members spilled the beans about Illuminati activity to nonmembers, often with alarming exaggerations. By 1784, rumors about the order had caught the attention of the authorities. The Bavarian government issued an edict banning unauthorized associations, and Weishaupt suspended the Illuminati\u2019s meetings. Material continued to leak, and scurrilous rumors were increasingly published by journalists and repeated by preachers, accusing the Illuminati of \u201cirreligion, disloyalty to the dynasty, political intrigue and moral corruption.\u201d\n\n&gt; In a last-ditch effort to exonerate his order, Weishaupt personally approached Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, and told him most of the Illuminati\u2019s secrets. It proved to be in vain. On March 2, 1785, Theodore issued another edict, specifically condemning the Illuminati. Weishaupt fled Bavaria. Investigations commenced, arrests were made, and masses of the Illuminati\u2019s secret documents, including Weishaupt\u2019s personal letters, were published for all to see. The Illuminati was gone\u2014but not forgotten.\n\n&gt; The discovery of a very real secret society with very real political aspirations, combined with the many horribly embellished rumors about its sordid, subversive activity, was a recipe for confusion and alarm. Already it was rumored that Weishaupt\u2019s secret society continued to operate, and had simply gone underground. Freed from the hassle of actually existing, the Illuminati grew to mythic proportions in the fretful imaginations of its critics\u2014not only in Bavaria, but across Europe and as far afield as the newly independent United States. The exposure of Weishaupt\u2019s Illuminati tarnished the reputation of the Freemasons, too. A few lodges really had been infiltrated, after all\u2014and who was to say that all the Illuminati operatives had been ferreted out. The conspiratorial machinations of subversive secret societies increasingly looked like a viable explanation for troubling events. And then the French Revolution happened.\n\u201cIt is very easy today to underrate the emotional shock of the French Revolution,\u201d Roberts notes. \u201cBecause it opened an era of revolution in which we still live, we are used to the idea of revolution in a way in which the men of the eighteenth century were not.\u201d Over the course of ten violent, chaotic years, between 1789 and 1799, the age-old ways of hereditary aristocratic privilege crumbled, to be replaced with a new, more egalitarian, secular society. The revolutionary ideas began to spread across Europe, and soon millions of people had been granted basic human rights that they had never before enjoyed, while the aristocracy suddenly found their power and wealth decimated. It was a profound and unprecedented transformation\u2014the rapid emergence of an entirely new political reality. People understandably struggled to come to terms with it. \u201cThe scale and violence of the changes . . . seemed to exhaust all conventional and familiar categories of explanation,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cSome new dimension of understanding was needed.\u201d\n\n&gt; At the tail end of the Revolution, in 1797, two authors published, almost simultaneously, books that provided that new dimension of understanding. One was Augustin de Barruel. Barruel was a French nobleman, an ordained Jesuit priest, and a polemicist. He had already earned some literary success for his publications criticizing the Enlightenment philosophy, based on his staunch religious views. In 1789, the year the French Revolution broke out, Barruel had published a pamphlet blaming it on the corrupting ideology of the Enlightenment and the weakness of the French clergy. But by 1797, when he published the first two volumes of his Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism, Barruel had become convinced that the whole thing had actually been carefully engineered from behind the scenes. \u201cEven the most horrid deeds perpetrated during the French Revolution, every thing was foreseen and resolved on, was premeditated and combined,\u201d he wrote; \u201cthey were the offspring of deep-thought villainy.\u201d The villains, he claimed, included the Enlightenment Philosophes, the Freemasons, and the Jacobins. But these groups, Barruel wrote, were only the \u201cmost obvious villains in a great plot whose authors and agents have been far longer at work and are far more widespread.\u201d Lurking behind them all, coordinating the whole scheme, Barruel said, was an even more powerful, sinister enemy: Adam Weishaupt\u2019s dreaded Illuminati, whose \u201caim is not merely the destruction of the French monarch but universal dissolution, the overthrow of society and religion itself.\u201d\n\n&gt; Scotsman John Robison, a professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, had the same idea. He published his book shortly after Barruel, under the snappy title Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the Secret Meetings of Free-Masons, Illuminati and Reading Societies, etc., Collected from good authorities. Though Robison disagreed with Barruel over a few of the details, his premise was the same. The Illuminati was behind the French Revolution, he said, and it was only their first step toward inciting total, worldwide anarchy. According to Robison, the Illuminati leaders \u201cdisbelieved every word that they uttered, and every doctrine that they taught . . . Their real intention was to abolish all religion, overturn every government, and make the world a general plunder and a wreck.\u201d In case his readers weren\u2019t alarmed enough, Robison warned that the Illuminati \u201cstill exists, still works in secret . . . Its emissaries are endeavoring to propagate their detestable doctrines among us.\u201d\n\n&gt; Nothing Barruel or Robison had to say was particularly original, Roberts notes. Even since the earliest years of the Revolution, rumors had circulated that the Masons or some other secret sect had a hand in it. Robison and Barruel\u2019s genius was not for invention, but integration. They took all the existing plot theories and wove them together into a single grand theory. It not only explained the entire French Revolution, but had the potential to explain just about anything that had happened in the world, past, present, or future. The clear, comprehensive conspiracy theory Barruel and Robison articulated resonated perfectly with the fears and needs of the moment. Despite being riddled with factual errors and logical missteps, both books were quickly reprinted, translated, and exported around Europe and across the Atlantic to America.\n\n&gt; The foundations of modern conspiracism had been laid. The petty plots of the eighteenth century and earlier could now blossom into an all-consuming political vision.\n\nThe entire Illuminati conspiracy was born after religious people couldn't accept the fact society was becoming more secular. So anyone pushing this conspiracy, you should think about that.",

For instance, the electromagnetic and weak forces at higher energies are identical(All 4 force carrying particles act like photons).This is called Electroweak theory. Under a certain temperature, 3 force carrying particles interact with the Higgs mechanism and acquire mass. We call this the weak force, and the main difference is the mass makes them more potent but much shorter lives(They lifespan is less then a protons width). Under even hotter temperatures, the electroweak force becomes identical to the strong force. At extremely almost plank temperatures gravity is predicted to be identical to the strong and weak forces. \n\nIt seems to me you are describing these same forces just putting magnetic in front of them.

They are a mirror image of what you create within this objective reality.\n\nYour sun holds, as all of your stars, much intensity of energy. This energy is projected collectively by all of the essences participating within this particular dimension and reality, and is exchanged. Just as you collectively create what you view within your weather as your storms, you also much more powerfully project collectively your energy, which feeds the action of this star. You are creating of its burning, for you are projecting of your energy to this object and allowing a free flow expression of undirected energy; energy that is not being moved and manipulated in specific creations, but is what you may term \u2013 in your terms figuratively \u2013 as a surplus of energy that you hold within any physical dimension, for one manifestation physically is too small to be containing of the intensity of energy that you hold within each focus. Therefore, you create many outlets for the expression of this energy.\n\nBut as to the object itself and its creating of realities in itself, no.

This is the huge universal life cycle of our \"spiritual consciousness.\"\n\nEverything followers the source pattern in some fractal way or another, and I really like the comparison between Phi and Fibonacci sequence, and the idea that as life continues, it evolves closer and closer to source (phi/golden ratio), yet never quite reaching it.\n\nIf some kind of feedback/storage/evolution consciousness type mechanic is built into the framework of the universe, then all of this comes back to the evolution of that. We are like the tiny head of coral, truly connected but experiencing our own individual realities.\n\nAnother fun theory that I entertain --we are unique amongst the dimensions in that we are the only PHYSICAL dimension.

Sitchin's books were criticized as conspiracy theory on grounds of mistranslations and interpretations of ancient texts, astronomical and scientific observations, and literalism of myth, both by scientists and religious institutions, who accept their literalization of ancient myths as true religion of god, so I don't see the difference between the two. One takes Sumerian tablets as his reference point and the other takes bits and pieces of canonical text and gospel written down by councils of rabbis and bishops later in history, telling similar (or overlapping) storylines. I don't see how one is a conspiracy theory and myth and the other isn't. Maybe they're all metaphors but obviously they're all still taken very literally as they're still enforced upon us and shape our world one way or another.      \n    \nThis is a conspiracy forum where things seem to be discussed with an openmind and the thread made me curious and that's why I'm actually asking a question here rather than trying to provide answers as I don't have them myself. There's all this talk about Lucifer and Luciferians. Who's this Lucifer? According to Jewish Bible, it's not the Satan described in Christian and Muslim belief, but rather an angel with the mission of being an adversary like u/LyleMillar said.     \n    \nWhat is an angel? Are Luciferians evil? How is the idea of a God and his angels and more or less credible than the idea of aliens landing on the planet, conducting certain genetic experiments on a species that is less advanced so that they can task them with certain missions? Or a bunch of expeditionary soldiers and a scientist landing on a planet or dimension and seeing much less civilized humans like in the movie Stargate and being worshipped as gods, especially if they defeat the current ruling 'god' on that planet. These are honest questions because I don't see a clear difference between two points of view in terms of credibility and believability.",

            "body": "&gt;Can someone provide some links to these articles on standing waves. \n\nhttps://jmag0904.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/what-are-scalar-waves/\n\n\"What is a \u201cscalar wave\u201d exactly? Scalar wave (hereafter SW) is just another name for a \u201clongitudinal\u201d wave. The term \u201cscalar\u201d is sometimes used instead because the hypothetical source of these waves is thought to be a \u201cscalar field\u201d of some kind similar to the Higgs Field for example.\n\nThere is nothing particularly controversial about longitudinal waves (hereafter LW) in general. They are a ubiquitous and well-acknowledged phenomenon in nature. Sound waves traveling through the atmosphere (or underwater) are longitudinal; as are plasma waves propagating through space (aka Birkeland currents). Longitudinal waves moving through the Earth\u2019s interior are known as \u201ctelluric currents\u201d. They can all be thought of as pressure waves of sorts.\n\nSW/LW are quite different from \u201ctransverse\u201d waves. You can observe transverse waves (TW) by plucking a guitar string or watching ripples on the surface of a pond. They oscillate (vibrate, move up and down, or side-to-side) perpendicular to their arrow of propagation (directional movement). Comparatively SW/LW oscillate in the same direction as their arrow of propagation.\n\nIn modern day electrodynamics (both classical and quantum), electromagnetic waves (EMW) traveling in \u201cfree space\u201d (such as photons in the \u201cvacuum\u201d) are generally considered to be TW. But this was not always the case. When the preeminent Mathematician James Clerk Maxwell first modeled and formalized his unified theory of electromagnetism in the late 19th-century neither the EM SW/LW nor the EM TW had been experimentally proven, but he had postulated and calculated the existence of both.\n\nAfter Heinrich Hertz demonstrated experimentally the existence of transverse radio waves in 1887, theoreticians (such as Heaviside, Gibbs, and others) went about revising Maxwell\u2019s original equations (who was now deceased and could not object). They wrote out the SW/LW component from the original equations because they felt the mathematical framework and theory should be made to agree only with experiment. Obviously, the simplified equations worked \u2014 they helped make the AC/DC electrical age engineerable. But at what expense?\n\nThen in the 1889 Nikola Tesla (a prolific experimental physicist and inventor of AC) threw a proverbial wrench in the works when he discovered experimental proof for the elusive electric scalar wave. This seemed to suggest that SW/LW, opposed to TW, could propagate as pure electric waves or as pure magnetic waves. Tesla also believed these waves carried a hitherto-unknown form of excess energy he referred to as \u201cradiant\u201d. This intriguing and unexpected result was said to have been verified by Lord Kelvin and others soon after.\n\nHowever, instead of merging their experimental results into a unified proof for Maxwell\u2019s original equations, Tesla, Hertz, and others decided to bicker and squabble over who was more correct. In actuality they both derived correct results. But because humans (even \u201crational\u201d scientists) are fallible and prone to fits of vanity and self-aggrandizement, each side insisted dogmatically that they were right and the other side was wrong.\n\nThe issue was allegedly settled after the dawn of the 20th-century when A) The concept of the mechanical (passive/viscous) Ether was purportedly disproven by Michelson-Morley and replaced by Einstein\u2019s Relativistic Space-Time Manifold, and B) Detection of SW/LW\u2019s proved much more difficult than initially thought (mostly due to the wave\u2019s subtle densities, fluctuating frequencies, and orthogonal directional flow). As a result the truncation of Maxwell\u2019s equations was upheld.\n\nSW/LW in free space however are quite real. Beside Tesla, empirical work carried out by Electrical Engineers such as Eric Dollard, Konstantin Meyl, Thomas Imlauer, and Jean-Louis Naudin (to name only some) have clearly demonstrated their existence experimentally. These waves seem able to exceed the speed of light, pass through EM shielding (aka Faraday Cages), and produce over-unity (more energy out than in) effects. They seem to propagate in a yet unacknowledged counter-spatial dimension (aka hyper-space, pre-space, false-vacuum, Aether, implicit order, etc.).\n\nBecause the concept of an all pervasive, material Ether was discarded by most scientists, the thought of vortex-like electric and/or magnetic waves existing in free space, without the support of a viscous medium, was thought to be impossible. However later experiments carried out by Dayton Miller, Paul Sagnac, E.W. Silvertooth, and others have contradicted the findings of Michelson &amp; Morley. More recently Italian Mathematician-Physicist Daniele Funaro, American Physicist-Systems Theorist Paul LaViolette, and British Physicist Harold Aspden have all conceived of (and mathematically formulated) models for a free space Ether that is dynamic, fluctuating, self-organizing, and allows for the formation &amp; propagation of SW/LW.\n\nHopefully this general overview has provided you with a better understanding of scalar waves and their provocative role in scientific history.\"",

But I never really cared too much for the whole debate. However, I already thought NASA were frauds. I've just seen too much damn evidence that shows how fake NASA and the ISS is. I think they put all of it in our faces. Hell, Simon Peggy, or whatever the dumb masonic bitch's name is, just broke the record for the most day spent in space. When she returns in September, she'll have spent 666 days in space. I've seen an astronaut with the eye of horus tattooed on him. All of the astronauts are masons. They get off on this kind of stuff imo. I think scientists, especially governments are certainly in on it. C'mon man, you think this New World Order stuff is just a joke? For the average person it is, but for them, it's their true end goal. \n\nThey've hijacked this planet. They've infiltrated our language. I'm not even sure humans were supposed to have a language. We spend our weekdays in a weak daze until we're weakened until the weekend. We Languish in our languid language, in anguish ever since the ancient times of the Anglish angus and the phony Phonetic Phonics of the ancient Phoenician Pheonix. \n\nEnglish was created from the ancient Phonic Phonetics of the Phony Phoenician Phoenixes, and it reflects the creativity and cunning genius of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all, unless you're just another rat, caught in the daily maze of the rat race of this human race against one another.\n\nWe draw money from our banks which are the edges of a river, which FLOWS in CURRENTS to the SEA, which is why its called CURRENCY, because our CASH FLOWS like pyroclastic ASH FLOWS toward the SEA, which is why we can trace back the ROOTS of all modern TRADE to the ancient Phoenician TRADE ROUTES,\n\nSpelling - spells. Writes - rites. Vowels - vows. Cursive - curses. Syllables - sibyls. \n\nThis planet is fucked up to the max man. At least in my opinion. Everywhere I look I see the occult. You can type in just about any term, for instance \"Mary Poppins Illuminati\" and you'll get results. Hell, I'm sure you can type in \"Whinnie the Poo Illuminati\" and you'll get a decent youtube video on it. \n\nI truly understand how hard and how bogus it sounds to believe in God in 2017. We've got kids with bone cancer, hurricanes, tornadoes. We've got fluoride in our water, chemtrails in the air (bio-engineering, it's real, trust me). Our schools prevent critical thinking. Our government stymies democracy. Churches crush spirituality. Everything is upside down. \n\nIt can be difficult to see through these evil fuckers in government, but when you let go and accept that they're working with evil forces, I just let go. The further I dove into the depths of darkness, the more I was fucking empowered by the light. I feel invincible with God by my side. You would probably think I'm even more crazy for believing in reptilians, and the goddess sophia, and christ. But I think this is one grand story for us to experience. I think God is about to reveal himself to the world soon. I just have this feeling in my gut that it's all about to fall down, really soon. I don't expect this link to help you much, but it just might. http://www.thepearl.org/Sophia.htm\n\nI am very positive Sophia (goddess of wisdom) is a real entity, and that she leads you to Christ. She has appeared to me in a dream before. I know it was her because what she did in my dream she did in the dream that another youtuber had. She had otherworldly beauty. I've also had an otherworldly reptilian dream. \n\nI think these sick fucks are working with these reptilians that live in a different dimension. Hence the reason for child sacrifices etc. I think they use the adrenochrome in the blood somehow to work in this dimension. I don't fucking know, but I hope I find our real soon. Cheers. ",

            "body": "What woke me up: \n\n2001, First we had 9-11. I was confused and wondered why some Muslims would do such a thing. I had only recently been going online and mostly used my computer for email and sending photos to friends. I was also learning a bit about HTML. Been a life long construction worker and read mostly science fiction in my spare time and had no interest in politics. So long as I had my job and a few friends I was unconcerned. That changed with the slaughter of 3,000 of my fellow Americans in one horrible day. \n\nI accepted the government narrative and even reassured a friend who was about to go down the conspiracy rabbit hole. After all, I was a steel worker. So I knew quite a bit about steel buildings. Or so I thought. I had never worked on a large sky scraper. So I thought I would educate myself about Muslims because I still couldn't wrap my mind around why 20 or so guys would conspire to commit such horrible acts. Unfortunately there were too many holes in the Muslim attack scenario. FBI involvement and who paid for the attackers to be here. Who financed this became a question. And the whole Islamic thing began to take on a dimension I had not anticipated when I became curious enough to read a Koran. At the same time my daughter who was 2000 miles away living with my ex wife and her husband committed suicide over her conflicts with her mother. I was distracted from wondering much about 9-11 for the next two years and then mostly just went from temporary jobs around the country in shipyards with no clear idea of what else to do but get over my personal pain and come to grips with the idea of an only child being dead. But the questions remained. The details were still in the back of my mind and I read online from time to time about things that didn't make sense to me. Then I lost my condo due to changing markets and a slump in building and construction during the recession of 2008. I began to question our basic monetary system. The real world had a way of making me pay more attention and question basic assumptions. I researched everything I could on 9-11, the monetary system of USA. IRS, FRB and issues going back a hundred years. When you are single and have evenings alone reading stuff online is a good distraction. Fast forward to today, I look back and believe I was extremely naive and clueless ten years ago. I question almost all media reports unless I can get it from multiple sources. Even then I try to look beyond the simple reporting and focus more on why things are happening the way they are and who the players are and who they work for or are aligned with. \n\n\nIn my mind, Hillary and her friends or associates who help her are pure evil. They are the source of many problems in the world today. Those aligned with her political ideology are nothing more than part of a world wide effort to keep the world's population either hopelessly ignorant and uneducated or at least brainwashed with constant media propaganda to the point they are not a threat. The rest of the small population that reads and questions are marginalized one way or another by a system that is stacked against them. Those who become a real threat to the rich and politically powerful are killed. It happens so regularly now that it's not even shocking. It's expected. Doctors who are a threat to big pharma are marginalized by firing or discrediting. If that doesn't work they are killed. Journalists are regularly sacrificed to the god of the super elite and powerful. Politicians are knocked off also if they become a problem. Trey Gowdy will talk a tough talk but what comes of it? Nothing. Comey makes the most outrageous statements clearing Hillary and her friends and nothing comes of it. It's all show. In the end, nothing really changes for the better. It took a national tragedy and a personal heartbreak for me to open my eyes and look around beyond my personal happiness. I think, for most people, that's just how it is. Grateful Dead made the perfect description when Jerry sang his song Ripple. The road to knowledge and awareness is indeed painful and lonely. Learn enough and you will find fewer and fewer friends until you learn to keep it to yourself.\n\nThen one day you begin to question if you are the crazy one and the rest of the world is sane. Or just asleep.  ",

Lucifer attempts to point that out to God, and that the higher dimension would be better served as a parliament or committee led system.

As the story goes, he created a paradise for us that contained no struggle, no suffering and no death, but hence lacked any and all incentive to evolve beyond that paradise of ignorance.\n\nIf the Ra material (The Law of One, the Hidden Hand dialogues) is to be believed, it was Lucifer (a group-soul of higher density/dimensional beings) was sent to earth to convince Yahweh to give us a chance to evolve in the karmic cycles by giving us a catalyst to do so.\n\nSo what we were given was a bright spark of curiosity and a sudden increase of hardship, forcing us to find our own ways and to continuously choose between serving ourselves or serving the whole of creation. Naturally, only the second approach will eventually lead back up the ladder of ascension, but we have to be shown and realize the things we are not so that we can choose to be our best selves. That is why the Luciferian group complex or higher dimensional soul collective has to be the bad cop in this game of life, to allow us to choose the good path with conviction.\n\nSo, if any or all of the above is correct, both Lucifer and Yahweh are neither good nor evil in itself, but wanted to achieve different goals in this game. Yahweh wished us to be good due to ignorance, worship and obedience, while Lucifer wants us to be good out of our own wisdom and free will. This also wouldn't absolve the Lucifer soul complex of its evil deeds in our dimension, as they would have to pay the price for it in the next karmic cycle. A prize they agreed to pay for our ascension.\n\nAnd to be clear, I don't know if any of that is true, but it's a version of our story that resonates, so I'll entertain it for as long as it does so.",

            "body": " String theory is the dominant approach right now, and it has some successes already, but the question is whether it will develop to the stage where we can actually solve problems that can be tested observationally. If we can\u2019t bridge the gap between this ten-dimensional theory and anything that we can observe, it will grind to a halt. In most versions of string theory, the extra dimensions above the normal three are all wrapped up very tightly, so that each point in our ordinary space is like a tightly wrapped origami in six dimensions. We see just three dimensions; the rest are invisible to us because they are wrapped up very tightly. If you look at a needle, it looks like a one-dimensional line from a long distance, but really it\u2019s three-dimensional. Likewise, the extra dimensions could be seen if you looked at things very closely. Space on a very tiny scale is grainy and complicated \u2014 its smoothness is an illusion of the large scale. That\u2019s the conventional view in these string theories. According to this theory, there could be other universes, perhaps separated from ours by just a microscopic distance; however, that distance is measured in some fourth spatial dimension, of which we are not aware. Because we are imprisoned in our three dimensions, we can\u2019t directly detect these other universes. It\u2019s rather like a whole lot of bugs crawling around on a big two-dimensional sheet of paper, who would be unaware of another set of bugs that might be crawling around on another sheet of paper that could be only a short distance away in the third dimension.",

This second view, in the tradition of **Gottfried Leibniz[17] and Immanuel Kant,[18][19] holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled.**\n",

And it's good to preach that message of open mindedness and fact based logical reasoning because it can force people to take a look at themselves.\n\nI just see too often people not *thinking*. They are too attached to their own emotions and opinions and get butthurt when what they thought doesn't turn out to be as black and white as they were told. \n\nIn reality, everything isn't in black and white. The gray area appears to be getting larger and larger, and people need to start realizing that there's nothing BUT gray area. And that's why it's sometimes difficult for me to convey a message. Because I don't want to divide, but that's inherently what a message does in the first place. \n\nWe are all trapped in this third dimension dominated by duality. Conflict. War. The illusion of progress. In order to *truly* make progress as a society, each individual must have an open mind and be unattached to their perceived \"self\". That's extremely difficult, and preaching that message can even be detrimental to the message itself. \n\nAwareness is the only way out. Consciousness. You are not your body. You are not your mind. Im saying it's time to set aside our bullshit pseudo differences, and come together as one fact and logic based community. Truth is absolute. There is no duality to a  legitimate logic based factual analysis. That's because you are taught to always acknowledge that there is another side, and to *qualify* the opposing opinion. \n\nSorry but shit gets really complicated and I appreciate you commenting on how murky the argument is because it really can get contradictory.

            "body": "2)Then there are the experiences of Cathy O'Brien, the mind controlled slave of the United States government for more than 25 years, which she details in her astonishing book, Trance Formation Of America, written with Mark Phillips. She was sexually abused as a child and as an adult by a stream of famous people named in her book. Among them were the US Presidents, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton and, most appallingly, George Bush, a: major player in the Brotherhood, as my books and others have long exposed. It w as Bush, a paedophile and serial killer, who regularly abused and raped Cathy's daughter, Kelly O'Brien,, as a toddler before her mother's courageous exposure of these staggering events forced the authorities to remove Kelly from the mind control programme known as Project Monarch. Cathy writes in Trance Formation Of America of how George Bush was sitting in front of her in his office in Washington DC when, he opened a book at a page depicting \"lizard-like aliens fro m a far off, deep space place.\"\" Bush the n claimed to be an 'alien' himself and appeared, before her eyes, to transform 'like a chameleon' into a reptile. Cathy believed that some kind of hologram had been activated to achieve this and from her understanding at the time I can see why she rationalised her experience in this way. Anyone would, because the truth is too fantastic to comprehend until you see the build up of evidence. 'There's no doubt that alien~based mind programmes are part of these mind control projects and that the whole U FO-extrat errestrial scene is being massively manipulated, not least through Hollywood films designed to mould public thinking. Cathy says in her book that George Lucas, the producer of Star Wars, is an operative with NASA; and the National Security Agency, the 'parent' body of the CIA.\" But given the evidence presented by so many other people, I don't believe that what Bush said and Cathy saw was just a mind control program. I think he was revealing the Biggest Secret, that a reptilian race from another dimension has been controlling the planet for thousands of years. I know other people who have seen Bush shape-shift into a reptilian,",

You're right, monetary corporate corruption is an inevitability. Nearly anything it seems can be twisted and wrung out until dollar bills are squeezed out. (Can't get blood from a stone, but capitalism keeps trying.)\n\n&gt;De-centralization is an option. But it's not necessarily working in practice at the moment, as we've seen with a number of groups in this modern era. Perhaps a compromise in between. A sort of... organized de-centralization. Or perhaps even a centralized de-organization.\n\n&gt;You familiar with Flatworlders? The idea that, to a flat land, a three dimensional object would appear flat. But it's an \"illusion\" because the flatlanders simply can't comprehend that third dimension.\n\n&gt;I think forces in this universe are sort of the same thing. Corporations, exploitation, money, these are all the observable manifestations of an exocosmos being. We can call it Capitalism, we wouldn't be far off in flavor to call it Mammon, either. Many know it as the Invisible Hand of the Free Market.\n\n&gt;Whatever it is, I fear 'waking up' isn't enough. It's a dragon compared to us, and mortals don't slay dragons.\n\nPerhaps. But humanity has slain many other \"dragons\" in the past. Things that seem everyday to us probably would seem impossible for someone from thousands of years ago. Not only technologically, but culturally too. \n\nI like your idea of a de-centralized organized structure. Kind of like the thepiratebay website, or the blockchain. Something that serves the basic function of government, while not requiring any actual people to lord over us to get it all done. Like a standardized schema that everyone voluntarily follows. I think it is possible. \n\nI bet getting rid of Kings and Queens seemed impossible during the dark ages. We are now in a similarly dark age. Don't let it fool you. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/65i9d8/energy_vampires_how_we_are_being_tricked_in_to/dgai3pq/?context=3",

Are they three dimensional? Then the afterlife is our escape -- but what escape involves dying to truly live?\n\nAlternatively they are four dimensional. This means they can manipulate us in the third dimension and potentially in the afterlife if that is also four dimensional. In that case, we again will have to see what's going on. We cannot prepare for this potential event right now.\n\nAs far as frequencies, we shouldn't have to worry about any nonterrestrial creatures interacting with us assuming the frequencies work that way. If they can't get here and we can't leave, then I'd say we're somewhat safe.\n\nI don't personally believe in archons or Gnosticism, but I am more than willing to entertain it and learn. It's more fascinating than other mainstream religions but isn't as arcane as the lesser known ones.\n\nWhat WILL help you in a spiritual, physical, and intellectual way is to just be good to your fellow human. Help people, but also help yourself. Be happy or at least content. Because whether these archons or reptilians are literal or metaphorical, they still want us miserable for some reason. Resist.

It could be people that are dreaming and my belief is that many realistic nightmares are actually astral projections/lucid dreams into the lower astral, even if the person is unaware that they are in another dimension. People who were murderers or extremely violent tend to hang around the lower astral as it is like being inside an actual horrific slasher movie. Somehow portals were opened that allowed extremely negative beings entrance to the middle astral. This is also were beings such as mothman, spring heeled jack and shadow people came from",

And most of the time I've appreciated your contributions, but I am yet to be convinced of your love and appreciation for other beings. Please give me a moment to explain myself and the meaning of this post. \n\nHuman beings are the _ONLY_ ones on the planet to consume other beings milk. Why is that? Becuase no animal need other race's milk! Human is the only one brainwashed (by their own race) into thinking other animals' milk is good for them.\n\nHuman keep dogs and cats in exclusive position in their field of appreciation, why is that? Because it has been done since time being and they are cute? Yes? Isn't that just one fking excuse to ignore the fact that \"your\" animal is just one of the other \"unvaluable\" beings in the nature?  Like you are in charge of any animal that happends to land into your illusional field of ownership? FUCK YOU! You dont own shit! You are just a fucking slaver who supresses other FEELING beings! \n\nWhat separates dogs' and cats' feelings from other animals' feelings? ASK that from yourself. Do they feel different? Are the different personalities? What makes human kill other animal beings? Lack of love? YES!\n\nHuman do not need meat to survive, it is true. Human Do NOT need meat to survive. Please listen to the follwin videos and learn. Remember: I love you. You are the source of power. I do not wish to harm you or anyone. I am glad to show you a path you've not come to see yet.\n\nBe true to yourself and others.\nBe vegan, a person who does not harm others. \n\nI very much would like you to listen and ponder of the following lecture by this great woker of the sleepers, the Best Speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4\n\nA great lecture by Manly P.

            "body": "IThe \u2018gods\u2019 were never identified by the gnostics of old with God - the pleroma - but known as Aeons. The word aeon referred both to an eternal spirit being and to an distinct sphere or dimension of awareness. Not all aeons were seen as having incarnate forms but some were regarded as sending messengers or emissaries to mankind \u2013 Seth being foremost amongst these. The spiritual entitly calling itself \u2018Seth\u2019 and channelled by Jane Roberts described himself as part of a larger aeon or \u2018pyramid awareness gestalt\u2019. To such trans-physical entities, awareness gestalts or aeons belongs a knowing awareness of potentiality of such potency or power that it is the source of countless consciousnesses and actualities. In the words of the awareness gestalt, entity or aeon which Seth himself described as his spiritual \u2018big brother\u2019:\n\n \n\n\"Our entity is composed of multitudinous selves with their own identities\u2026Physically you would find me a mass smaller than a brown nut, for my energy is so highly concentrated. It exists in intensified mass\u2026perhaps like one infinite cell existing in endless dimensions at once and reaching out from its own reality to all others. Later, in your time, all of you will look down into the physical system like giants peering through small windows at the others now in your position and smile. But you will not want to stay, nor crawl through such small enclosures\u2026 We protect such systems. Our basic and ancient knowledge automatically reaches out to nourish all systems that grow\u2026\u2026there is a reality beyond human reality that cannot be verbalised nor translated in human terms. Although this type of experience may seem cold to you, it is a clear and crystal-like existence in which no time is needed for experience\u2026in which the inner self condenses all human knowledge that has been received through various existences and reincarnations\u2026.for all this has been coded and exists indelibly. You also exist now within this reality. Know that within your physical atoms now the origins of all consciousness still sing\u2026We gave you the patterns behind which your physical selves are formed. We gave you the patterns, intricate, involved and blessed, from which you form the reality of each physical thing you know.\n \n\nWe are the voices who speak without tongues of our own. We are sources of that energy from which you come. We are creators, yet we have also been created. We seeded your universe as you seed other realities.\n\n\nWe do not exist in historical terms, nor have we known physical existence. Our joy created the exultation from which your world comes. Our existence is such that communications must be made by others to you.\n\n\nVerbal symbols have no meaning for us. Our experience is not translatable. We hope our intent is. In the vast infinite scope of consciousness, all is possible. There is meaning in each thought. We perceive your thoughts as lights. They form patterns.\n\n\nBecause of the difficulties of communication, it is nearly impossible for us to explain our reality. Know only that we exist. We send immeasurable vitality to you, and support all of those structures of consciousness with which you are familiar. You are never alone\u2026We have always send emissaries to you who understand your needs. Though you do not know us, we cherish you.\n\n\nSeth is a point in my reference, in our reference. He is an ancient portion of us. We are separate but united.\n \n\n\n-SETH on the Sethites of Old\n\nThe well-recognised Sethian stream of ancient gnosticism saw in the biblical Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve, and in his progeny, the bearer for mankind of **Inner Knowing or Gnosis. ** Seth was also recognised, like Christ, as an aeon \u2013 a trans-human entity. Seth was also the name of an Egyptian god of desert storms \u2013 a god who came eventually to be demonised. The trans-physical entity naming himself Seth whom Jane Roberts channelled, at one point addressed the members of her class in extra-sensory perception and had this to say about the name Seth, the god Seth and what it means to be a \u2018Sethite\u2019.\n\n\n \n\n\"There was once a god who was not a god \u2013 who was not a god, for you are dealing with legends. There was a god in ancient Egypt, and his name was Seth, and he was disreputable. And he threw aside establishments, and whenever other gods rose up and said \u2018We are the truth, we are pure and we are holy\u2019, this disreputable god stood up and, with a voice like thunder, said \u2018You are nincompoops! .\n\n\nAnd the other gods did not like him, and whenever they set up their altars, he came like thunder, but playfully, and tossed the altars asunder, and he said \u2018Storms are natural, and good, and a part of the earth, even as placid skies are. Winds are good. Questions are good. Males and females are good. Even gods and demons are good, if you must believe in demons. But, structures are limited.\n\nAnd so this god, who was not a god, went about kicking apart the structures, and he gathered about him others who kicked apart the structures. And they were themselves, whether they were male or female. Whether they thought of themselves as good or bad, or summer or winter, or as old or as young, they were creators. They were questioners.\n\n\nAnd whenever another personality set itself up and said, \u2018I am the god before you and my word is law\u2019, then Seth went about saying \u2018You are a nincompoop\u2019 and began again to kick apart the structures. And so you are yourselves, in your way, all Seths, for you kick apart the structures, and you are the black sheep of the physicians, and the black sheep of your mothers and fathers, and your sisters and brothers.\n\n\nAnd yet, the mother and the fathers and the sisters and the brothers listen, for they do not have the courage to be the black sheep, and they quale in the voice of the thunder that is so playful, though they do not understand it, for they equate loudness with violence, and they think that female is passive and the male is aggressive; and that war and violence must always erupt from the reality of mankind.\n\n\nAnd you are indeed all black sheep of the universe, and Sethites have always been the black sheep of the universe.\n\n\nNow to be a Sethite, you do not have to follow this Seth. You simply follow the Seth in yourself, and that Seth in you is a questioner, and an explorer, and a creator. And the Seth in yourself knows when to passively flow with the wind that blows through the window above a summer town, and when to go against the force of your environment. You were Sethites before you met me, and there was a Seth before I was Seth, and the spirit follows through the ages as you know them.\"\n",

He alludes to the general consensus that there are beings who are out there to drain our life force.(If you believe this which I do.) However I am weary of anyone saying to avoid the light but he makes a good argument.\n\nHis main idea that I think is very important is to trust yourself **above all**. To connect with yourself and then to connect with the earths core. But most importantly that these beings want us to believe a higher power or enlightenment is something outside of us that we are unable to feel or experience without guidance. Trust your instincts because beings that want to abuse us want you to worship them. As stated in an earlier comment, friendly beings will not want to be worshipped or offer promises of divine knowledge and then disappoint you when nothing happens. That is what they want so they have more \"food for thought\".\n\n It kind of goes along with what I believe that the spirit world is a seperate place we are able to visit.. But I believe to go further than that to connect to ourself as a whole, you must look within yourself. Could the astral realm be a hotbed of ill intention towards humans? Perhaps but I believe it is just an area they have infested and to put it simply co-opted our main communication channel with possible friendly entities. The idea of \"archons\" tricking folks into entering a new cycle of reincarnation that is seperate from the creators will is plausible in my opinion.  And seems to kind of align with the strategies of what we deem evil in our world. (Example CIA). To co-opt a noble intention and morph into their own will. \n\nWe were given free will to use it, and surrendering yourself to a higher power has always sounded off to me. Even as a youngin 11 years old I believed in god but couldn't care less for religion as it is. Although I believe many are legitimate, I also believe their true core beliefs have been changed over history and translations. I also had this unshakable belief that reincarnation was very real. If our reincarnation cycle is false and we are being reincarnated just to experience pain and hardship is a valid observation. They could very well have trapped us in an imperfect clone of our previous dimension (Mandela effect anyone?) But one could also argue that pain and hardship lead to soul enrichment and a more mature outlook on life than someone who always had it easy. \n\nAnyway just my opinion my friend who is also me. We are all on a journey to learn what we are at the core of it all.",

She mentioned how girls are being sexualized earlier and earlier, which limits their ability to mature as *people* due to having these sexualized roles thrust upon them and puts them at higher risk for victimization. Lastly it degrades gender relations as boys and men learn to see all female people as purely sexual beings, rather than seeing the adult females as *people* with a sexual dimension. \n\nI blame mass media and the porn industry.

The world is run by satanists who are running pedophile rings so they can perform sex rituals that intentionally conjour demons and open gateways for possession. Many important powerful families are generational satanists who are born into it. The Rothschild family and the bushes etc are all from satanic bloodlines. The shape shifting stuff is just demon possession and the fact that demons can manifest in this dimension in any form they want. They can look like aliens are represented to look like according to abduction reports because aliens are actually demons. But to walk the earth they have to possess a body. And that requires a human being who is willingly or unwillingly possessed. Just like with Christianity, satanist can be true believers or just be posing.  \n\nThe reason these pedophile ring participants in high ranking positions are not busted is because all of the most powerful people in the world are satanists. They own the media that brainwashes us to be atheists and to think Christians and conspiracy theorists are crazy. Satanic symbolism is embedded in all the major corporate branding, movies, tv show's and songs. \n\nThe church people who warned your mom were right.there is heavy subliminal satanic symbolism in children's cartoons. ( google satanic symbolism and Disney). Also, there are hand gestures satanists use such as Devil horns and the 666 hand gesture (also known as A OK hand gesture). You will see trump, bill Mahr, other top celebs and political figures posing with these hand gestures. It's not really meant to mean \"A ok\" or \"rock on\" when they use those gestures. The mainstream meanings were created later since secrecy is key to their agenda. You'll notice they will place their eye in the center of the hole they make with the 666 hand gesture which reinforces the satanic symbolism by adding the evil all seeing eye of lucifer symbol by highlighting one of their eyes in photo shoots and on film. It's real. That's why all of this is happening. It's a war for our souls as hard as it is to believe after decades of media brainwashing to think religion is bs. Christianity is the only true religion and Jesus is the only living God. This is what I've come to believe. It all makes sense and comes together when you look at it from the point of view of there being a God and Satan. Why else would mankind destroy the earth and eachother? We are being manipulated by a spirit world we no longer acknowledge. The satanists are using those symbols to cast spells on us while leading us away from God through mainstream media.",

It is not limited to any group, any family, any selectivity of consciousness within this dimension. It is all-encompassing. It is agreed, but you have also previously, in your terms, agreed within your religious focuses to be creating of prophecies and ideas of future events, also in your terms, which are probabilities. They are not actual realities that are unchangeable.\u201d\n\n-Basically the summary of that would be our biblical prophecies so many believe will be the event doesn't necessarily mean it will happen that way. Already many are questioning the absolutes in religion and our origins. But on a religious front you have this event of global flood, or other religious prophecy. This belief is contributing and lending energy to the event. The seas are rising. Caps are melting. So we are somewhat on that course of a flood.\n\nFrom science you have a comet impact or a whole host of other doom scenarios. Those aren't quite the focus but will be soon. But anyway our science and religion has prophesied many things. Aliens. Light travel. These ideas of the future all become probable realities. Collectively we agree on which path to take. Though we have agreed to shift our consciousness, and unbeknownst to either religion or science.\n\nBut there is not much prediction about what that would be like. Becoming our higher self. Or cosmic awareness. What does any of that mean? See, we have no materialistic predictions of what the shift in consciousness will be like. But that's the path we are really on.\n\nConsciousness is awareness. People aren't quite Aware yet. The collective is not quite Aware yet, and that is because we aren't done shifting because our events are how we wake ourselves up.\n\n",

In truth, time is an illusion that is used by the self as a means of being able to understand the phenomenon that is change. In higher dimensions, 'time' isn't something we'll have to deal with, I think. In order for change to be experienced as change, one must exist within time. In a higher dimension, change is more likely viewed as 'happening' -- not something within time -- and thus there is no longer that limitation of time.\n\nHaha, sorry. I get deep with this stuff. But you sort of have to, because these topics always consider physics and certain phenomenons in their understanding. Beyond that, when you go through a spiritual awakening to reality, a fundamental pillar of your reality becomes the truth that the only time and place you have ever been is now. In that sense, in the 3d world, time is also illusory. What is the past? Now. What is the future? Now. What is now? What is. This sort of mode of thinking/realizing is what makes me think along such relatively insane lines haha.",

Antarctica is not home to beings which will destroy the Earth; it is home to beings which will defeat Darkness / The Fallen / The Cabal.\n\nAsk Stratfor why they talk in emails about how they created the Men in Black long before the movie ever existed.\n\nAsk Stratfor why they had operatives inciting the 2008 Republic of Georgia riots which lead to Georgia attacking Russia and not the other way around.\n\nAsk Stratfor why they had \"special agents\" at WTC 1 on 9/11\n\nSoros = Hungarian\n\nStratfor founder = Hungarian\n\nHungary...the quiet and unassuming nation you never think about...has had far larger of a role in all of this the past 400 years than you'd ever imagine.

You are already near people everyday, people who you can help, I guarantee you there are people with hands reaching out into the community, but no one is reaching back to them.\n\nDon't lose hope, if you lose hope, I will lose hope, so I will tell you that I have hope that some day, everything will get better, and their will be far more love in the world. Some of the most stressful stuff I have ever faced has been forced upon me, but I will never lose hope because their are people I see everyday I can help, talk to, etc. \n\nYou feel it. It's not that you are preachy, it seems to me that you are evolving into a more empathetic and spiritually aware person. \n\nWhere the fuck do we start?: There are people in our city, our neighbourhoods, maybe even in your home that need a loving hand, a guide, someone to show them how to take the first steps. \n\nCan we, as a sub, band together to expose the real enemy/conspiracy?: Why? We already have, we are all here, yes we have been infiltrated and harassed, but in the end they made themselves look stupid. \n\nObviously it is near impossible, but can we put together concrete evidence to at least give us a start?: No. We have tried to do this for years, and we have ever presented concrete evidence, comet pizza being a good one, anyone remember the \"shooter event\" where they moved the CCTV camera on that street watching the pizzeria during that day, so they could gut the place? People believe it was an actual fucking shooter. My mom thinks someone died during that day, she is fully controlled sadly.\n\nWe can call it the \"NWO\", but that's not an actual name.: No, we aren't going to call them by anything like that, they are parasites, people who must use others to even survive. Nothing is more spiritually weak or pathetic, un-empathetic as being unable to survive without controlling people. Control is the ultimate form of fear. Soo much fear, they MUST have control, so they can put that \"fear\" to rest. \n\nI don't know anything for a fact, but in my heart, something tells me their is Divinity, your right, it doesn't give a fuck about us atm, this dimension is clunky, dirty, and pathetic in terms of how the third dimension has been explained compared to higher dimensions. It is waiting for us to decide, or do something here, before it lends a hand. There are many gifted people in this world who will tell you it feels like they have a guardian spirit, I believe it is just some form of higher Divinity that is \"unlocked\" after an \"achievement or task\".\n\nWho are the elite, if they must have control due to their mass fear, if their is something more than this life, then they are truly weak, controlled, and used, they may have control of us, but in the next dimension, they are likely someones slave. It is said masons/cults/elites/etc know about other dimensions and etc etc, if these people know their is something more, why would they have fear? \n\nTo me, it seems like these people have submitted to something that is not Divine, for power here and now, and their fear stems from some type of prophecy/or something a long the lines that they have submitted their souls, and they can no longer walk the Divine path. \n\n\nIf your serious, just worry about what change and hope you can bring to the world surrounding you everyday. \n\nP.S: I recommend avoiding talking to anyone IRL about taking action in regards to conspiracies, enough action has been taken in the past and the results of those actions (nothing) have shown us that it is not the right path.",

            "body": "Ah, this seems a good enough place to drop this word picture:\n\n&gt; a somewhat parallel Earth, or even into another time frame of the Earth they were in\n\nIf we consider time in itself as a true dimension such as the 3-d of space, we can think of \"sideways\" time, when \"straight\" time, which aligns unidirectionally from past to future, is seen as a layer of simultaneous times separated from each other by contingency (that is, the many possible actions that could have been taken in this world but were not).\n\nWe actually use this expanded time dimensionality quite commonly in ordinary speech and thought. We say \"The British might have defeated the Colonists and the USA would not now exist.\" If that contingency (the American Revolution was stopped) had both been a real possibility, and then had actually happened, then there would at present be a \"parallel world\" in which we would have a very different political history (assuming \"we\" is meaningful, since perhaps \"we\" would never have been born). However, if we think only of the contingency of the most recent presidential election (had Clinton not Trump won), then the alternative \"time frame\" would be very similar to the present reality, just with us talking about different political events than the ones we actually are.\n\nScience since the Greeks has been pretty strong on the unreality of contingencies. Our linguistic structures are well-adapted to orient conversations as to whether what we are saying has happened, could have happened, is happening, will happen, or might happen. The very definition of science is based on throwing the statements about \"could have happened\" or \"might happen\" out the window.\n\nThe exception of course is the science of statistics and probability, which deals with contingency directly. Like the weather, a flipped coin, a rolled dice, or any other randomly generated number cannot be predicted, because we cannot measure the multitude of influences that will cause the result. Like an atom discharging a subatomic particle to kill a Schroedenger's Cat, only the ability to measure any contingent result is sufficient for science to admit its reality. \n\nHugh Everett's multi-universe interpretation of quantum-scale randomness is the suggestion that two parallel universes are created when the cat either dies or lives. \n\nThe Philadelphia Experiment somehow transported into such a parallel universe, and barely made it back.\n\nOne more comment: most people miss the implications of living inside an infinitely infinite swarm of possible universes, both at the largest (infinity of universes), the smallest (infinity of particulate structures) and personal (infinity of life-stories).\n",

The spiritual world is better to use as a description since the fourth dimension is a difficult concept to convey or understand. A three dimensional shadow can be reflected from the fourth dimension into our dimension or something like that that I can't explain well off the top of my head. It can reflect inside its mirror image in the fourth dimension blah blah blah. Sounds like a hologram. Maybe demons exist in that dimension and under a certain light can project their shadow into our dimension.  Our brain sees things 2 dimensionally and has to use reasoning to see it as 3d.  Somehow we see these 3d shadows projected from the 4d when our critical faculties are lowered. Perhaps our rational minds can only see these shapes in a half alert state which is why humans tend to see demons when falling asleep or meditating or drugged. It doesn't follow our natural laws so it's out of context of what most people or I can easily follow without putting some time into researching it. As an anology similar to trying to understand the fourth dimension in order to believe demons exist, I can acknowledge a light bulb is using electricity without being able to explain exactly how it's done. I'll just call it the spiritual dimension so I'm not tying it to an existing scientific theory. \n\n&gt;\"Little, if anything, is gained by representing the fourth Euclidean dimension as time. In fact, this idea, so attractively developed by H. G. Wells in The Time Machine, has led such authors as John William Dunne (An Experiment with Time) into a serious misconception of the theory of Relativity. Minkowski's geometry of space-time is not Euclidean, and consequently has no connection with the present investigation.\"\n&gt;-H. S. M.

In the bigger picture disclosure is right around the corner even if it takes 20 years. From what I've read, the apparent advanced and benevolent ET's are waiting for humanity to evolve as a whole spiritually/mentally before they come out and greet us lol.\n\nIt's difficult for a lot of people to care or even have interest in this stuff. But if you take a bunch of psilocybin mushrooms and stare at the sky for a few hours you might be 100% convinced that a love imbued intelligence from another dimension definitely exists. The \"aliens\" might be a lot more mysterious and different than hollywood has portrayed for us.

You say, \"Man, look what we found here, Einstein, \" or whoever you're talking to, Tesla - whoever you're talking to. Problems of the future can be solved by mankind because you create them. And you have to believe in the future, it's what we have to do. We progress, we always progress - we try to. So the Sumerian tablets, they say the same thing like Genesis said, that there were chariots of fire that came into the sky. And these beings got out of them, and they walked like a man but they had reptilian features. They had snake-like eyes, a tail, and, uh, scales, right? And they were - they were here, and they made slaves out of the people. And where they landed in is what the Bible calls the Garden of Eden. They were trying to inbreed with the people here. The women would die, the babies would abort. But after two thousand years they started taking, the babies started being born and living. And they had tails, they had a few reptilian features. They could phase shift from one dimension to another dimension, and the people who know say it's from the fourth dimension - the next dimension. Space is expanding; there are spirits coming from the center, right? We're going counterclockwise. There's supposed to be eight other universes going counterclockwise, and that's called Superuniverse, you know? And love's always been the message. It's just - circumstances happen, right? People freak out, just flat flip out, you know? Well, that's where Hitler came from, Hitler came from that way. He was an outspoken, charismatic yeller. And, and all these people said, \"Hey, we'll use this guy, hey, look at all these people listening to this guy.\" You know what I mean? And so that's just what the trip's like, that. You know? It still exists, and their bloodline goes back - back into Sumerian times. You know, they didn't call it reptilian, they didn't call it that. But they did, because they called him Satan, they called him the Devil, and it's the same damn trip. It's a negative force, coming in on a positive force, because it's a third dimension, right? And for it to solidify or to crystallize, it has to have both elements, right? And you have to keep it in balance, or it will, it will, one of them will destroy the other...\"",

            "body": "Full text below:\n\n\nMike Quinsey 4/28/2017\n\n\nThere is much activity taking place in Antarctica and discoveries are being made that will alter your history that barely covers your true Human development. There are very interesting finds such as the bodies of extremely tall Beings, frozen exactly where they were when the freeze came upon them. They came from a period many, many thousands of years ago and it is not intended that you should get to see them. Those controlling such events want to continue keeping you in the dark and keep the full truth to themselves. However there are also those who are fighting for full disclosure and that is likely to happen if they get their way. Certainly with only a small number of years likely before Ascension takes place, there is a sense of urgency to get the truth out into the open. It is your history that needs to be rewritten and you have a right to learn the facts and they cannot be withheld forever.\n\nThese times are very testing for most people, particularly for those who have little knowledge of the truth. They cry to God asking for release from their experiences, without knowing that they are necessary for their evolution. It applies all around and for many it is their final life in the lower dimensions and why it can be hard going. However, the toughest times on Earth are the ones that give the best opportunities to overcome much karma, and progress to a higher dimension. Whatever level you are at these are times of great opportunities that can propel you ever onwards. As always your Guides follow your progress and do as much as is permitted to help you succeed. Call upon them when you feel in need of their help, and more often than not they can give it.\n\nMany wise and evolved souls have incarnated at this time to be mentors to those about to ascend. Their experience will help you to be successful in achieving Ascension, or advance your understanding so that you can at least make good progress. You will find that many young souls are in fact wise old souls, coming into your lives to give you knowledge that will put you on the path to truth. They usually exhibit great knowledge and understanding at a young age and should be taken notice of for that reason.\n\nThe dark Ones are creating the circumstances of their own demise because of service to self. However, whatever they do they cannot compete with those souls who are of the Light who are immune to their negative energies. Like attracts like so providing you are true to the Light you cannot be touched by them. Of course you will be concerned at their actions that include murder and many depraved acts, but you must keep from being brought down by them. Bear in mind that you attract to yourselves exactly what you give your energy to, so guard your thoughts and reactions in respect of negative situations that you may learn about. Humans are prone to getting involved with other people\u2019s lives which is fine providing they know how to do it without becoming emotionally involved. Life can sound difficult at times but by keeping to your desire to act out of love for your fellow travellers, it should be rewarding and plain sailing.\n\nGenerally people seek to be \u201cwell off\u201dand many earn that right by hard work. But it becomes extreme when money becomes your god, and you seek riches that are unnecessary for your well-being. Having great wealth is a challenge as it must be used for the good of all people and not selfishly used for self-aggrandisement. Yet a very small number own 95% of the worlds wealth, whilst millions live on a pittance without proper housing or sanitation. Something has gone seriously wrong and the accumulation of wealth has taken place at the expense of ensuring a reasonable standard of living for everyone. These problems are intended to be dealt with very soon and will come into force before the end times are reached.\n\nHaving been given freewill you are the architects of your own reality. However those who rule clearly exercise a much greater degree of power, but as you are in a democracy you are able to voice your opinions. Having made your choices it authorises those who oversee your lives to influence the future to your advantage. For example you have had the benefit of new ways of doing things, and inventions that have lifted your quality of life. However, you have not been given things such as free energy that would have taken you into the New Age, and made life much more comfortable for you. Instead you are held in a time warp where life can be a drudge and many people have insufficient means to survive. This cannot go on for much longer and already steps are being taken to remove the obstacles that are preventing a complete change for the better.\n\nYou the people are putting out strong thoughts that are creating a new time line that lifts you out of the old one. Soon there will come a time when the powerful energies being created will suddenly cause beneficial changes to happen. As more and more people envisage the changes that are possible they bring about their manifestation, a point having been reached where they can no longer be held back. So the importance of keeping focussed on your goal must be emphasised. It is a time when you must concentrate on your own needs if you are to take the opportunity to ascend.\n\nYou have many friends and family waiting to meet you again, and some will visit the Earth whilst others will not do so until it is safe. Many are waiting to greet you after Ascension has taken place who are not directly involved in your life plan. They are family and friends from many lives where you have met and worked together. Such links are rarely broken, particularly where a bond of love has been made. When you are in the higher dimensions friends are only a thought away, so no matter where you are contact is possible. However, the point must be made that if a soul is otherwise engaged in some activity that cannot be interrupted, you may not receive a response.\n\nYou have no need to be concerned about those souls who are unable to ascend with you, as they will be looked after and given every opportunity to be successful next time round. Understand that every soul gets the same opportunities to gain knowledge and progress, but some need more time to incorporate the new understanding to their advantage.\n\nThe Light has won the battle and very soon all shall see peace settle upon the Earth. This will allow the changes to go speeding ahead and put the dark times behind so you can enjoy your new found freedom. You will love being part of the new Earth and give your time to being involved in the changes for the benefit of all.\n\nThis message comes through my Higher Self and carries the energies of Light and Love.\n\nMike Quinsey.\n\nhttp://awakeningforums.com/thread/484/quinsey-antarctica-giant-beings-ruins",

Cleaning it so it works again can be done, and it can occasionally be made to work with the right tapping or banging.

Somehow they initiated some sort of portal through the veil during the Experiment. Entered this portal briefly, went to a somewhat parallel Earth, or even into another time frame of the Earth they were in.  But do to lack of understanding they didn't return properly.  They returned off center. They should have returned and be overlayed directly over the exact same space they had left.\n\n But there was something that interfered.

The vibratory distortion of sound, faith, is perhaps one of the stumbling blocks between those of what we may call the infinite path and those of the finite proving/understanding.\n\n&gt;You are precisely correct in your understanding of the congruency of faith and intelligent infinity; however, one is a spiritual term, the other more acceptable perhaps to the conceptual framework distortions of those who seek with measure and pen.\n\n&gt;3.10 Questioner: Then if an individual is totally informed with respect to the Law of One and lives, and is the Law of One, such things as the building of a pyramid by direct mental effort would be commonplace. Is that what I am to understand? Am I correct?\n\n&gt;Ra: I am Ra. You are incorrect in that there is a distinction between the individual power through the Law of One and the combined, or societal memory complex mind/body/spirit understanding of the Law of One.\n\n&gt;In the first case only the one individual, purified of all flaws, could move a mountain. In the case of mass understanding of unity, each individual may contain an acceptable amount of distortion and yet the mass mind could move mountains. The progress is normally from the understanding which you now seek to a dimension of understanding which is governed by the laws of love, and which seeks the laws of light. Those who are vibrating with the Law of Light seek the Law of One. Those who vibrate with the Law of One seek the Law of Foreverness.\n\n\n&gt;We cannot say what is beyond this dissolution of the unified self with all that there is, for we still seek to become all that there is, and still are we Ra.

Part of it is because you've been manipulated, but you all need to start taking accountability for yourselves and actions.\n\nTesla's theories about energy, frequency, vibration and reverberation thereof impacting future events is 100% correct.\n\nThus, here's a starting point. \n\nRealize that you have been cockroaches, in the grand scheme of thighs, for a very long time and are still here bc benevolent forces finally stepped in on your behalf.\n\nTo start seeing the 4th Dimension, you have to be selfless, kind, merciful, loving, etc.\n\nMany of you are descended from races known as Lyrans, Arcturians, Sirians, and Pleiadians.\n\nI'm of the Pleiades and volunteered with 144,000 others to come down and help you all.

            "body": "&gt;We did not start the war with Islamic extremists, \n\nOf course we did. Wars are not only started by a direct attack or legitimate only if the USA declares it so. You will be able to find much evidence that ultimately, the root cause of all of it is oil disputes. A simple history lesson will teach you that for a decade the CIA was supplying 'radical' Islamic groups in Afghanistan (Mujahideen or \"those who engage in Jihad\") with weapons and war supplies via **Operation Cyclone**, for no other reason than because they were fighting 'evil Russia'. Now this was 1979-1989. Clearly, our government had no problem with radical Islamic groups back then. Why not? They were the same people with the same beliefs as they hold now. Ah, but they weren't 'terrorists' because they were attacking evil Russia instead of us! Makes sense...fighting for their freedoms against the evil commies and all! Looking at the shit Reagan said back then is like another dimension. Reagan is literally talking about radical Islamic groups and calling them 'defenders of freedom' and 'freedom fighters'. He even makes up a story about how the Soviets were 100% using Chemical Biological Weapons (yellow rain) in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia in order to garner more anti-Russian support. A claim which there was apparently no conclusive evidence for even to [this day:](https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/vci/rls/prsrl/57321.htm)\n\n&gt;In 1984, President Reagan formally reported to Congress that the Soviets had \"repeatedly violated their legal obligation under the Biological Weapons Convention and customary international law as codified in the 1925 Geneva Protocol\" through \"their involvement in the production, transfer and use of toxins and other lethal chemical warfare agents that have been used in Laos, Cambodia and Afghanistan.\" This position has continued to be the official policy of the United States government, even though the Yellow Rain findings have been strongly debated in the press, academia and even within the government. \n\n&gt;Recent non-governmental reanalysis of the Yellow Rain investigation suggests that while the evidence most strongly supports the hypothesis that chemical/toxin attacks occurred in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan, **the scientific evidence is not strong enough to answer with certainty questions regarding the composition of the agent, the intent of use, or whether the agent originated in the former Soviet Union.**\n\n\nSeems familiar to the 'Russian election hacks' bullshit, except the people just had to accept whatever the President said back then because there was no internet. There's your proxy war against Russia by supporting 'radical' Islamic groups.\n\nThen around about 1990 Saddam decides to invade Kuwait over OIL, and guess what...Team America World Police didn't like that one bit. So we banded together with the UN, leading the charge to impose severe sanctions on Iraq. Another proxy war against Iraq, started by us. Sanctions that did no harm to Saddam or his rich cabal, but instead resulted in the suffering of millions of Muslim civilians who depended on our aid. You've got numbers hovering around 500,000 child deaths as a result of these sanctions. This right here was probably the main turning point, when AlQuaeda/Bin Laden decided they wanted to use our own weapons against us. They were [*freedom fighters*](https://reaganlibrary.archives.gov/archives/speeches/1983/32183e.htm) when they attacked Russia, but when they decided to fight for their freedom by attacking the USA they suddenly turn into *terrorists*.  It was definitely cited by Bin Laden in his letter to America as one motive. How would you feel if any other country caused, either directly or indirectly, the death of 500,000 American children? The \"radical Muslims\" who were first called \"freedom fighters\" when they fought the Communist occupation and morphed magically into \"terrorists\" when they fought the Western Democratic occupation is no surprise. The Mujahideen didn't fight the Commies because they wanted to have a US Democracy instead. They want their own freedom, and that includes freedom from the control of the USA.\n\nThe US Government was just itching to take Saddam out since the Kuwait war, but had no remote justification for a direct invasion. History teaches us that the American people do not support wars which are not began by a direct attack on the American people (Vietnam War).\n\nUntil a bunch of Saudi Arabian men directed by Osama (also Saudi) hijacked airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center, giving the USA pretty much free rein to invade ANY MUSLIM COUNTRY EXCEPT SAUDI ARABIA on a whim, under the guise of fighting a 'war on terror'. Need Americans to support the invasion of Afghanistan to clean up the mess we created with **Operation Cyclone**? Terrorisms...the evil Bin Laden lives there! Iraq and Saddam? Terrorists want to kill us all there too, + weapons of mass destruction! Drone strikes killing more civilians than 'terrorists'? Collateral damage! Hospital bombed? WOOPS! Children killed in Yemen operation? Yemen schyemen!\n\n**\u201cOf course the people don\u2019t want war. But after all, it\u2019s the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it\u2019s always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it\u2019s a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.\u201d**\n\nOne thing is clear from even a small amount of research: They didn't attack us unprovoked or for the purpose of 'taking away our freedumz'. It's all about oil and money and who controls it, nothing more. The Middle East was infighting because of oil disputes, and the USA figured it wanted to be the one who decides what countries control the oil. If anyone took our freedoms away, it was our own government via their mass surveilance program entitled the \"PATRIOT act\". I mean it has to be good for us right? It has the word 'patriot' right in the title! Anyone who questions it must be anti-American!! Or better yet, the [\"Freedom Act\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act)! Must be good for our freedom, says so right there! Anyone who opposes that must be **anti-freedom**!\n\n**\"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\"** The Orwellian tactics began long before Trump was elected, despite what the MSM wants you to believe.\n\nNow, was 9/11 staged or an inside job? Is Osama living the good life inside some Saudi palace right now? I don't know, and it doesn't really matter, because all of the things I posted here are historical fact...and that's scary enough.\n\n&gt;but I can tell you for certain we will finish it.\n\nHow is that? How will the most powerful country in the world 'finish' a war with a bunch of brown people who live in fucking caves? By dropping more bombs on them and killing even more civilians for the next 20 years? There is only one way to end it, and that is to stop interfering in foreign affairs where we are not wanted.",

            "body": "Was Nikola Tesla getting visions from or communicating with a Parallel Universe or Dimension? \n\nTesla's Unique Research Methods\n\nLet's return to the middle XIX century, to the little village Smilyan in Lika, which was Austrian-Hungarian province. In this village on July10, 1856 Milutin Tesla, a Serbian Orthodox priest, saw the birth of his forth child, Nikola Tesla. Tesla's family didn't want him to study at the Polytechnic Institute, especially his father, who (required) wanted him to be a priest. Nikola felt a deep and insatiable vocation to be an electrical engineer and he felt sick due to this disagreement. When crisis came and it became evident that Nikola might die (from illness), his father finally agreed with the desire of his son. Soon Tesla recovered as if it was a miracle and was absorbed in inventive fantasy. After strenuous mental efforts, he began to suffer from a strange phenomenon. He saw clear visions sometimes accompanied by a strong light flash. It is the ability of people who have para-psychological power -\n\n\"In my boyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance of images, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which covered the sight of real objects and interfered with my thought and actions....When a word was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itself vividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whether what I sow was tangible or not.\"\n\nHe also described his spontaneous mind traveling:\n\"Then, instinctively, I commenced making mind trips beyond the limits of the small world of which I had knowledge and I saw new scenes. These were at first very blurred and indistinct, and would flit away when I tried to concentrate my attention upon them but, by and by, I succeeded in fixing them; they gained in strength and distinctness and finally assumed the concreteness of real thing. I soon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in my vision further and further, getting new impressions all the time, and so I began to travel - of course in my mind. Every night (and sometimes during the day) when alone, I would start on my journeys, see new places, cities and countries, live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and, however unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as real and dear to me as those in actual life and not one bit less intense in their manifestations. This I did constantly until I was seventeen, when my thoughts turned seriously to invention.\" from \"My Inventions; Nikola Tesla's autobiography.\"\n\nTesla noticed that he could clearly visualize his discoveries, he didn't need experiments, models or drawings. In such a way he developed his own methods to give material form to his creative ideas. Tesla sharply distinguished ideas, which were coming into his mind as visions, and those, which appear due to analytical mind clearance. Tesla explained:\n\n\"The moment when somebody designs an imaginary device and is connected with a problem of transfer from raw idea to the practice. That is why any discovery made this way has lack of details, and usually it is inferior.\"\n\nTesla used another method, entirely. He did not hurry nor follow with an empirical check. When an idea appeared, he immediately began to elaborate on it in his imagination. He would change its design, improving it -and would \"switch on\" the device to begin its operation in his head. For him, it did not matter whether he tested his invention in the laboratory or in his mind. He could notice if something would prevent his invention from working properly\u2026 in the same way he could develop a perfect idea without any physical touch. Only then would he give a concrete look for this final product of his mind. All his inventions were developed by this method - with no exceptions, during twenty years\u2026\n\n\"There is hardly any scientific discovery that can't be foreseen mathematically, without visualization\u2026 Introduction of unfinished, crude ideas to the practice is always a waste of energy and time.\"",

Technically, if souls exist, reincarnation cannot exist, you would just transition from one plane of existence, to the next, if this is so, why is there a step back? \n\nMany people have lived on Earth, and although we live in fancy times now, many people still suffer daily, and have for all of existence. \n\nHonestly, would you want to come back to this plane of existence if you passed onto a new one with new opportunities? I am going to venture a guess and say you wouldn't want to come back, so why do people come back?\n\nSome can say some have experienced great things and long to relive those moments, but the idea of going to a new plane, would also mean everyone else goes there, all you would have to do is wait. \n\nWhy the jump back?\n\nMy theory, I hate this theory, because it sounds insane, but for those who has read up on as much random shit as I have will understand:\n\nIt is likely that our souls are used as an energy source for something trapped, where it is trapped, probably in the dimension right above us, it is likely that it also requires something if it is not further capable of evolving, meaning it would deteriorate, in some incomprehensible way. It is likely we are used as an energy source, because we can create something or do something, something about us is desirable. \n\nI believe afterdeath, or the next plane of existence, is more hostile than this one, but after that one, it is bliss. It is likely that we are capable of something great, but keeping us here is beneficial in some fashion. \n\nI have read up a lot on Jesus, and there is only two things I will say: \n\nHe is written about in multiple Semitic Religions, and even if they are all a rip-off from egypt, it is likely a lot of this warfare, battling, between \"gods\" where just beings of a higher dimension that transitioned here. The thing that is weird, is that Jesus was always written about being ascended, and Holy, always, he also died and came back, which is resurrection, but I can tell you for a fact, tons of these people/kids who come back saying they were fighter pilots and war heros and surgeons/etc, actually all of them, never stated anything about faith, religious ideologies, etc. \n\nThis tells me that a lot of what is written is about action in our solar system, seen through astral projection, that is why they knew shit was there, they didn't need a telescope. Jesus likely ascended beyond whatever we are imprisoned in, the idea of the Da Vinci code (never actually seen it, lol) and other shit referring to jesus having kids and etc, is likely all just to mislead people. \n\nJesus was likely a person birthed by a virgin, but conceived through astral projection/sex, and due to this, was able to ascend upon death, into the 5th dimension, and being in bliss, was able to return, and have power, and try to lead people to the 5th dimension, or to try to teach people to astral project to make a bunch of astral babies. \n\nThe theory folks. \n\n\n\n",

I started a little younger than you, and it helped me grow and become who I am today. My only regret is not living out a fulfilling childhood because I was too preoccupied with what was happening. \n\nIf this is the route in which you want to take yourself, then that's fine. Be smart, be cautious, and don't believe everything you read here. \n\nLook at each side of every coin. \n\nMaybe aliens do exist, and maybe they don't. Aliens could exist on a spherical earth surrounded by a never ending universe, or they're made up so we don't think so much on the fact that WE ARE the only lifeforms living out our existence on a flat dimension that we call \"earth.\"\n\nMaybe god is real, but more than likely not properly explained by any modern day religion. I'm a spiritual guy, certainly not religious. Maybe god isn't real, and we are a byproduct of chance that grew to form consciousness. \n\nNo theory is too crazy to believe. We haven't even explored most of our planet. We don't know if there are hidden technologies to produce clones, we don't know if the earth is actually round, we don't know that queen Elizabeth is not a reptilian, we don't know if the earth is hollow, and we certainly don't know who/what control this planet. \n\n As for \"awakening\" those around you, you must realize that is no easy feat. Someone who has been asleep since their birth and their mind closed so tight may never wake up, even with proof of something slapping them in the face. You can not \"awaken\" someone who doesn't want to be woken up. You can't convince someone of something if they don't want to listen. I have made many friends open their eyes to new truths because they were open minded and I presented the information in ways to get their gears going. It's not a matter of \"dropping bits and pieces\" because they won't follow a trail of crumbs if they don't want to. It's about deep conversation with information ready to present and knowledge on both sides of the argument. Remember, never say no. It's always \"yes, and\" to show their point is valid but there is more to their point that actually ties in to your own. \n\nI'm happy to see a young person, such as yourself, interested in finding what is inside of them, and opening their eyes to what could be true. Remember, we are soldiers. We are in the middle of a war right now. Coming soon, lives may be lost of our regime. We are the Seers, and those of power do not like how much we see, and how convincing we can be. \n\nStay vigilant, OP. ",

I think it is related to the Law of One channelings in some ways although I have only read little parts of those. \n\nI'll try to give a super short summary, although I am in a mental state at the moment where it's often hard to rationally express things in words or consciously remember details, it's always more of a feeling but hard to put in words..\n \nBasically that \"we\" came to this place/earth to experience this lower denser physical dimension but were higher spiritual beings before. The \"first wave\" who came didn't work out well, and ended up being in mixed bodies like half horse half human, half fish half human, half goat half human. That's where all these images of centaurs etc. come from. \n\nThen a second wave came to try to \"rescue\" the first wave. That was also when Atlantis was established, the leader of them being Thoth, who later incarnated as the Egyptian Thoth and also as Jesus. What they did not anticipate was that the disconnection from unity was so strong and that the separate self was such a strong illusion. Soon some wanted to just indulge in this separate self, in the book they are called the sons of Belial. There was like a \"split\" in the Atlantis society, and through exploitation of earth's resources (for example something similar to fracking) they caused a catastrophe that led to the destruction of Atlantis. Some fled and tried to pass on or preserve their knowledge. \n\nSo some important points are that the illusionary separate self causes all \"problems\" in this world. A lot is talked about unselfish love and how this is a path to \"enlightenment\". Also that a \"real\" teacher who already transcended his selfish separate self is important to have, as a mirror to reflect and show you your own separate self. So a true teacher is either 100% or not at all without a middleground. And in this sense there are warnings about charlatans or just people who are stuck at different levels of their separate self because that place feeds their spiritual ego. Or warnings to be careful with channeling which is only a positive expression for something that can also be called \"possession\" by an external entity and not to rely on it for spiritual growth or completely trust the message. \n\nWhat's interesting is that it is written as the personal account of someone who joins these people hidden away somewhere in the Himalaya/Tibet region, one of their outposts. They call themselves Children of the Law of One and preserve the ancient teachings of Atlantis and pass them on, and often the same incarnations will find their way back, in some ways the book even reminded me of the movie Dr. Strange..\n\nAlso that there is in a way a battle between \"good and evil\", as that the sons of Belial from back then are in \"power\" at the moment and behind a lot of the manipulation and programming and the \"bad stuff\" that is happening in the world or talked about here in this sub.",

You will either be a cute little pet, a beast of burden or a quick dinner.  You will never be on equal footing with anything you encounter.\n\nA shark is helpless on the sand and a man is helpless in a rip tide.  Learning how to swim before jumping in the ocean is ideal.

That is Dimensional Analysis, where quantities such as Mass, Time, Distance, and others are used to normalize a problem in order to estimate how varying the scale of a problem effects some output.\n\nThat was tertiary information, but perhaps could help with reframing your bias. \n\nSo, continuing, **the greatest, most powerful \"not-understood\" dimension is \"consciousness\"**\n\nHe who controls consciousness, legitimately, and undeniably controls the future, present and past.

That combined with all these recent finding of civilization existing long before we thought (or were told to think) any existed is making this pretty coincidental to say the least.

The reason I am including it here is because it is the most viewed FBI Document in history. Here is an excerpt\n\n \nAccording to a declassified document released by the FBI, not only are we being visited by Alien beings from other worlds, but we have been visited by \u201cbeings from other dimensions.\u201d\nThe official link from the FBI vault can be found here: http://vault.fbi.gov/UFO/UFO%20Part%201%20of%2016/view\n\nIs it surprising that the FBI has shown interest in the study of the UFO phenomena? Is it possible that many science fiction films are actually based on real events, or better called \u201cleaks\u201d given by the government in order to deliberately raise awareness among the population?\n\nIn 2011 after some documents were \u201cdeclassified\u201d a report written by a special agent of the FBI in 1947 reached the public. The special agent of the FBI, a lieutenant colonel whose identity, remained anonymous because of \u201cnational security\u201d gather numerous data on the UFO phenomena after interviewing and studying the phenomena for years.\n\n\n \nAccording to reports and \u201cDeclassified\u201d documents, we have been visited by numbs extraterrestrial species, some of these, are not only from other planets but from other dimensions. Some of these beings originate from an ethereal plane coexistent with our physical universe. These \u201centities\u201d that could \u201cmaterialize\u201d on our planet appeared as giant translucent figures.\n\nfbi-interdimensional-ufos\n\nHere is a transcript of some of the most important details of the report:\n\n1. Part of the disks carry crews; others are under remote control\n\n2. Their mission is peaceful. The visitors contemplate settling on this plane\n\n3. These visitors are human-like but much larger in size\n\n4. They are not excarnate Earth people but come from their own world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. They do NOT come from a planet as we use the word, but from an etheric planet which interpenetrates with our own and is not perceptible to us\n\n6. The bodies of the visitors, and the craft, automatically materialize on entering the vibratory rate of our dense matter\n\n7. The disks posses a type of radiant energy or a ray, which will easily disintegrate any attacking ship. They reenter the etheric at will, and so simply disappear from our vision, without trace\n\n8. The region from which they come is not the \u201castral plane\u201d, but corresponds to the Lokas or Talas. Students of Esoteric matters will understand these terms. http://www.ancient-code.com/the-fbi-admits-visits-of-beings-from-other-dimensions-declassified-fbi-document/",

            "body": "It's really hard to define so I'm going to give it my best shot.\n\nFirst you need to consider that everything in this universe is composed of either energy, frequency, or vibration. This was Tesla's theory at least before we understood quantum mechanics.\n\nWhen my third eye was closed my periphery of the universe as I understood it was very limited both physically, and intellectually. I would grasp basic concepts, but never really saw the interconnected nature of the universe. I was preoccupied with and unable to see the true nature of the world around me, and was selfishly only really aware of myself, my own energy, and frequencies and didn't really care to understand the frequency and energy or vibrations of other beings, and even objects. I was blocked from tapping into the collective consciousness of humanity, and felt isolated and disconnected.\n\nUpon waking up I realized that everything in this universe is both connected, yet isolated at the same time. Almost like a computer where everything is broken into tiny little pixels. Together they form a whole picture, but individually they're isolated from the rest of the other pixels and have their own unique identity when you zoom in close enough. While some pixels might be red, others are blue, etc. yet together they form an entirely different image.\n\nAt the quantum level, every atom contains the data necessary to be anything else in the universe. What this means everything in this universe can be anything. So the atoms that make up your body or just like those pixels and can be any color. They are the same atoms that can be a tree or a chair, or an item or being on another planet. At the quantum level, we are all a part of the same system. The entire universe we live in is composed of the same universal laws and structures.\n\nOne of the variables to quantum reality is that when an observer, or consciousness is present, then quantum physics behaves differently. Meaning, consciousness itself has a direct implication on reality at a quantum level, and that directly changes the reality we live in. A different set of rules are applied at a quantum level due to the mere presence of consciousness.\n\nSo then this raises the question of what is consciousness? How can consciousness effect quantum physics and reality?\n\nWhen you then consider the possibilities and potential for consciousness, especially when you think about reincarnation, DNA, innate knowledge, etc. Then the potential and possibilities are rather endless. We do not know or understand what consciousness really is, but we do know it has the power to change reality which is incredibly powerful.\n\nOnce you question the true nature of self, what we like to call \"I\", you realize that who you are and what your consciousness is built upon layers of predefined reality. The fact of the matter is every consciousness is unique, and pure consciousness without all the constructs of conditioned modern life is not as preoccupied with self, but is instead more interested in being connected with others and is made up of the same atoms and pixels as everything else. Consciousness does not want to be alone or disconnected, or isolated from the rest of humanity and the universe.\n\nThen when you factor in multi-verse theory, and the possibility of infinite universes this really opens up the realm of potential and possibility. So what we think of as aliens, ghosts, etc. could simply be beings from another universe, or dimension. We know based on advanced imaging studies that the brain processes information in at least 11 different dimensions, and that's just what we've been able to identify so far. Other universes may have other dimensions, and other dimensions may contain other universes.\n\nWhatever dimensions we have access to in this reality and this universe is also unknown. It is possible all the universes and all of the realities and all of the possibilities are all connected somehow, yet also stand alone with their own unique laws and potential. So what happens when these connected yet stand alone universes interact with each other? Is that where consciousness comes from?\n\nThe human body contains at least 7 different energy centers, or charkas, or whatever you want to call them.\n\nThe 3rd eye is the 6th energy center from the base, and is supposedly the root of the soul, or the source of consciousness and intuition. It is your pure consciousness if you will without all the conditioning. It is who you're programmed genetically to be. It is your connection to the source of what defines you.\n\nIf you apply Tesla's theory, the human body is merely a receiver of sorts for connecting quantum reality to consciousness. So frequency, vibration, and plasticity are critical to the proper functioning of the human body and connecting us not only to our pure consciousness, but also to the rest of the universe (the crown charka which is the 7th above the 3rd eye). Supposedly people who can access the crown charka and navigate it are able to potentially reach higher dimensions of being, also heard people who take DMT can have similar experiences.\n\nAnyhow, this has gone on long enough and probably appears to be the rantings of a mad man. I have no idea how much truth is contained within what I just wrote, but ultimately I never thought about any of this stuff before I woke up to the possibility and potential of our species, and universe. If this is my third eye being open to be able to consider and question and ponder all these possibilities then so be it, if it is something else well then I lack the words to explain it.",

            "body": "I have a similar view. I just spent about half a year digging into this subject. Taking a break now. We go down the rabbit hole and we reach the Dracos. The thing is, while I've seen/heard enough evidence for Nordic/Humanoid ETs and Greys (Tall/short), I have not seen anything to support the Dracos. So all this tied up story about them being behind it all, that H.W. Bush is a reptilian, as was Clinton and (every political leader of major country) except now the Donald. Come on. These are humans who want money and power. Even if there was some bloodline, there's people who are born within families that are totally different in character and their agenda then the rest of the clan. The blood doesn't determine who you are. And shapeshifting may be possible, but not here in the physical world, maybe in the astral or inner dimensional (another topic).\n\nThe patent OP references here, I looked into that. The guy submitted them like 10 years ago and abandoned them. So they are not patents, but actually bogus. The description of how the TR3B works is not the same the guy (Fuchs?) who leaked it out first describes, so there is inconsistency. Someone is BSing. (edit: Why would the DOD allow publication of a classified top secret anti gravity space craft when they suppress thousands of patents?) One ufologist thinks he's a **schizophreniac**. Did you check out his walk thru walls training patent? yeah see if it works (wear a helmet). \n\nSo back to what conclusions I found. Dr Steven Greer's \"connect the dots\" arguments are most clear and backed up. Guy is credible and he's not a reptilian, GTFO with that. The whole main reason for secrecy is the alternative energy technology and it's threat to the established monetary system. This leads further to the big global warming debate. \n\nI think people have a problem that there may exist another dimension besides this one, as that enters into the **paranormal** and the dreaded seemingly debunked religion area.. they can't accept that. They rather accept the Draco story. It's interesting how religious people have to face reality and accept science, but equally interesting how science people have to face reality as well and accept that there is a paranormal/other dimension that is behind this one. They are both in denial but the more \"science camp people\" are having even a harder time looks like.\n\nUfologists want the physical UFOs and crafts. Yes, some were knocked down using **Tesla** inspired tech, scaler weaponry (\"death ray\"). We have them now in the underground super secret bases. We have ships that use both man's innovation and augmented by ET tech that they were able to back engineer (though mostly not able - still too advanced). Flux Liners or **ARVs** and **TR3Bs** there is evidence for each, and we may be able to space travel with some variant of. \n\nMy conclusions: global warming by man made fossil fuel burning is (one) significant factor contributing to an unnatural and dire global warming **rate**. The people behind keeping fossil fuels as the main energy source, are part of a transnational kabal keeping alternative energy sources (based on human innovation and augmented by ET technology) suppressed. At the same, this same group counters the man made fossil fuel warming via geoengineering in order to help cool the planet, thus in the process polluting the air, water, and planet on both ends to keep their petrodollar macroeconomy in place. They are able to accomplish this working behind the military industrial/security complex in illegal, unconstitutional covert operations under the guise of national security, funded by trillions of embezzled dollars.\n\n\"The agendas within this group (against Disclosure), are separate and competing. One would be **macroeconomical** control - global domination- they want the oil system, their utility systems in place, it's all about macroeconomy for those guys. Those are more of the real political folk like Papa Bush (Rumsfeld). Then we have people, as I mentioned who are **epistemological**. They would love to see a final battle that would happen, that would result in the end of the world, so that their Messiah, or Christ, would return. They're religious nuts. They make the Taliban look like liberals.\" Then you have the **sociopaths** - who really love endless war. They love torture. They love destruction. They're addicted to it. And I met with some of these people, they are true psychopaths (Dick Cheney, etc). Scary characters. Then you have a group who don't know how to come clean without it being the biggest scandal.. imagine we learn that we have all these technologies to replace oil. There's an inertia that this secrecy has. They just want to retire and go fishing **without the trouble**.\" -Dr. Steven Greer\n\nSo. Groups that want secrecy/against disclosure are:\n1. Business guys\n2. Religious nuts\n3. Sociopaths/psychopaths\n4. Don't want to rock the boat/no trouble\n\nReptilians may exist somewhere, and on some other planet. But I have not seen any evidence for them. Yes I heard Mr Icke's lectures, not sold on the bloodline or shapeshifting thing. Are they in the Earth, with entrance from the Antarctic somewhere? **No evidence.** Mr. Goode seems to have had his mind messed with by the military CIA maniacs for this alternative alien threat/bad alien invasion they have as a card to play. (Human slave ships?) I sooner believe in the foot tall humanoid creatures examined by Sirius Disclosure, because we have the freaking bodies and there was three of them, one alive at one point. **Hard evidence.**\n\nBecause Trump appoints such pro fossil fuel guys, and is aligned with Putin and his petro wealth strategy, I don't see Disclosure with this presidency. This despite him not being a reptilian lol\n\nedit: Made some minor grammar edits. Also, wanted to add 1990/end of the Cold War seemed to be the most appropriate time for Disclosure, we are way past that. ",

You realize that the darkness of the world is a direct reflection of the shadow that still exists inside of you.

As the master inside of me begins to awaken I realize I have held the power all along.\n\n&gt;By Nikki Sapp\n\nshe is \"on the nose\", as our British mates might say, when it comes to this ego and label thing\n\nif we were to take a yellow sticky note and write a label on it, and sticky it to you, you would have so many labels that you would look like Big Bird \n\n\"american\"\n\n\"woman\"\n\n\"black\"\n\n\"accountant\"\n\n\"baptist\"\n\n\"chiefs fan\"\n\n\"republican\"\n\n\"feminist\"\n\n\"pro-choice\"\n\n\"pretty\"\n\nso one major problem, as far as i can tell, is that once you identify with and/or associate with a certain label, then you instinctively/reflexively defend that label and reject its opposite.  \n\ni suspect one reason we do this is because it takes hard work and dedication to try and fully understand all of life's most prominent issues. \n\nfor example, how many \"pro-choice\" people have spent a lot of time trying to understand the \"pro-life\" mindset, beyond some shallow stereotypical memes?\n\nhow many \"feminists\" have spent an equal amount of time trying to understand mens issues?\n\nhow many \"americans\" have reached out to a \"russian\" and said \"hey lets be friends!\"\n\nhow many \"chiefs fans\" are going to \"see\" a questionable call by an official in a way that favors their own team?\n\ni suspect that at some level, (((TPTB))) understand this about human nature, and therefore work very hard to instill these labels in the minds of people at a very young age... \n\n*why would you even ask* a grade school student to pledge their allegiance to a flag?\n\nso anyway, we are all tarred and feathered with these yellow sticky note labels, and we don't even realize it, and therefore do not realize that it is a problem\n\nyour challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to find a way to drop your own ego, and drop all of the labels, similar to a house of cards collapsing. \n\nthe sensation could be compared to a snake shedding its skin, or a chick hatching out of an egg, or a \"re-birth\", doffing dirty clothes. \n\n[seek and ye shall find](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=mushrooms)\n\n \n\n",

            "body": "Our entire solar system was created on purpose by \"higher-dimensional\" beings (who are actually us in reality), as was our entire universe. Our laws of physics are merely the language by which our particular singularity translates higher dimensional ideals into lower dimensional \"physical\" reality. We are purposefully designed to allow the higher-dimensional aspect of ourselves, the divine unity of all, to cessate into our physical vessel. This is as simple as looking at our DNA and seeing that its shape and configuration is predicated directly by the frequencies of light that emanate from our Sun, from our melanin production levels all the way to how we code for neurotransmitters that directly influence our mood (I.e. SAD, Vitamin E deficiency, Hemaglobin production).\n\nEach Galaxy has its own Solar Systems governed by their own Suns that emanate life on their planets through their particular solar configurations. Life is very common throughout the Universe as our entire Universe is a conscious being itself which speaks through languages we may call physics, chemistry, and biology.\n\nThe arrangement of each of these life-bearing solar systems is belied by a system of energetic movement from the higher-dimensional planes of cosmic unity all the way to physical unity, for life traverses the staircase between action and ideas by sitting upon the buttress of what we call the soul or spirit, which binds the two together into one product. The staircase is typically as follows:\n\n1. Environment\n2. Physiology\n3. Emotion\n4. Feeling\n5. Thought\n6. Action\n\nThe basic process for traversing this staircase is determined by the divine will that resides in each of us and we can choose how to assess it, through either ideas (1., 3. 5.) or actions (2., 4., 6.), but in order to properly move we must alternate constantly between both, as to walk smoothly we must utilise no less than two feet.\n\nThese 6 steps can be abstracted to the Tree of Life through Sephiroth 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. The movement from the higher dimensional conciousness of Will to the lower dimensional conciousness of Thought to the lowest dimensional conciousness of Action. These steps are as follows:\n\n1. Highest Wisdom\n2. Intelligence or Spirit\n3. Magnificence\n4. Fear\n5. Victory\n6. Honor or Glory\n\nThis can also be thought of as the movement from Collective Conciousness (Superego), to Individual Conciousness (Id), to Personal Consciousness (Ego). The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Active Intellect (Wisdom)\n2. Passive Intellect (Understanding)\n3. Superego\n4. Id\n5. Active Action\n6. Passive Action\n\nSo on and so forth.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, these 6 aspects of life can be split into two pillars, The Pillar of Mercy and The Pillar of Severity, representing the Masculine (Penetrative) and the Feminine (Absorbtive) respectively. This duality is also mirrored the design of the mind, being split into two hemispheres, and the nervous system, being split into the sympathetic and parasympathetic, and the brain, being split into the Forebrain and Hindbrain.\n\nReally we can think of it from the growth of the binary Reptilian Brain, to the quaternary Primate Brain, to the superpositionary Human Brain. The Will of the Reptilian Brain is dictated primarily by Dopamine and Cortisol, the risk-and-reward system on a self-interested level. The Will of the Primate Brain is dictated primarily by Oxytocin and Serotonin, the prisoner's dilemma system on a self- and else-interested level. The Will of the Human Brain is dictated primarily by Wisdom and Intelligence, a mixture of all Four of these Neurotransmitter \"elements\" into complex forms and ideas. These each represent the HindBrain (Reptilian), MidBrain (Primate), and Forebrain (Human). Humans aren't really particularly special, we just happen to be the ones to develop these types of brains the fastest given the configuration of our solar system and other factors but these types are indeed necessary for the physical world of matter to mirror the spiritual world of ideals through the quasi-physical/spiritual world of thoughts and emotions. All life however ultimately seeks to unite with the spiritual world of cosmic unity with all things because it's what everything comes from originally and where everything will return to.\n\nOur job here on earth is to master the Three Pillars of our Life: Mercy, Severity, Mildness; Masculine, Feminine, Childlike; Active, Passive, Neutral; Light, Dark, Void; Fire, Water, Air/Earth; etc. and is why our entire Solar Systems and Universes were created.\n\nI think we were very aware of all this and how we are a reflection of our solar system and universe once upon a time, but the knowledge has been consolidated and obfuscated over time to render people pliable and powerless, like a ram without its horns we have have become mostly sheep. Calcination will inevitably need to take place before we can return to the true spiritual enlightenment of seeing ourselves as spiritual beings having a physical experience rather than physical beings having a spiritual experience.\n\nI also wanted to elaborate on the dimensions:\n\n1. The 1st Dimension, this is the static interaction that occurs between two quanta, electron-electron, proton-proton, proton-electron, etc. and the EM Field, Gravity, Weak Force, and/or Strong Field produced by this quantum interaction. In chemistry we would call this a Linear bonding geometry.\n2. The 2nd dimension, a relationship between three objects will always require a basis of two vectors/lines to move between them if they are not in a line. This is where Planar geometry takes place on the quantum level and represents the flatness of space that is layered upon itself to create the 3D Universe. In Chemistry this is typically Trigonal Planar bonding geometry.\n3. The 3rd Dimension, the overall geometry of our Universe removed from time that seeks to unite the 4 regions of 3D space (Front/Back, Top/Bottom, Side, Mix). In Chemistry we call this a Tetrahedral bonding geometry and it is the first time we leave the planar world to enter the world of volumes. The stacking of Lines (1st Dimension), Planes (2nd Dimension), and Volumes (3rd Dimension) are the tools by which our singularity/demiurge tries to mirror the divine will (7th Dimension, we'll get there in a second) in which it exists. This is the dimension that our actions arise from and act on directly.\n4. The 4th Dimension, the plane where we can view the 3rd Dimension at any point in time. This is the dimension from where our thoughts arise from and act on directly because we can view our Universe as it is, was, and could be, stringing the three together using thoughts (which is really just our spirit navigating a 4D manifold of our 3D Universe).\n5. The 5th Dimension is where the Universe exists simultaneously at every point in time (think this scene from Interstellar: ).\n6. The 6th Dimension where the Multiverses exists, every possible Universe at every possible point in time.\n7. The 7th dimension is also the 0th Dimension that creates the quantum fluctuations by which everything comes into a physical existence, this is an Infinite Number of Multiverses all existing simultaneously at an Infinite Number of points in time. This is where we originate from.",

The Sirians are a member of the Galactic Federation of Light which is an organization of over 250,000 individual Star Nations. The Earth has a Crystalline Consciousness Grid of 88,000 nodal points for example Giza, Sedona, Stonehenge, Shasta, and Chakra 6 Iran Afghanistan border. The global vibration rises every day and we are approaching our Ascension point which will begin with the Fall of the Dark Cabal, currency reevaluation, disclosure of the classified true nature of the universe, and distribution of the prosperity funds to all. There will be a 2 week period called the event when the old systems are replaced. Immediately after the event certain individuals will come forward and educate people on Galactic culture for the purpose of a series of mass sightings of UFOs. After a little more than a month the all clear for the mass landings will be given. At any point in time there are over 1,000,000 ships in orbit around the earth. The 3000ft Cigar shaped craft is massive for a scout ship and small for a mid-size craft which are normally about 20 miles long 600 feet wide and 6 decks high, however the mother ships average 100 miles across and the Base Stations can be 1000 to 1500 miles in diameter capable of housing 10 motherships. All of these ships are normally cloaked vibrating faster than the 3rd and 4th dimensions. Since most of these higher dimensional races are 5th dimensional or higher they are non-physical/quasiphysical plasma light beings. Any time they want to interact with a 3D civilization they density there ship and manifest a physical body. However if you open your third eye chakra you will be able to see the astral and etheric relms and you would see beings all around you. The Sirians established a base in 2013 in Antartica for the purpose of carrying out there 7 year survallence/ mentor mission. The Sirians monitor every earth humans thermic fields, dimensional stability, chakras, and stress levels which determine what we manifest from hepto-plasmic-holons into physical matter. The Dark Cabal is composed of the Human illuminati / Jesuits which is an organization that was created by Archons (demons) and reptilian beings physical and non physical. For the last 13,000 years the Illuminati families have coveted humanities wealth by helping the Archons feed off of the lower human emotional suffering by creating non-human entities called corporations. Large groups of people over minor chakra points or womb chakras can effect the global health of the earth energy grid. For example Syria, the Ukraine, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki. If the people are Unifidyed at these locations then there is a exponital benefit to the entire earth if they are at War there is spiritual degradation. The American CIA has been attempting to slow down or stop the Asension process by infiltrating opposing racial groups in certain strategic areas. The Sirians have been Telepathically organizing the awakened Ground Crew Lightworkers to counter the Illuminati mischeve. In 1945 the ethiric soul of the Earth Gaia sent out a distress call to the entire universe after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed. Thermonuclear weapons destroy the morphogenetic Feild of the universe by destroying all the energy down to the atomic level. This destroys the 1st dimension through the 12th. The distress call sent out in 1945 iniciated a mass migration of souls to incarnate on earth in order to bring more Light and Love. Starseeds are hybrid souls that have lived a wide variety of ascended lives as many different beings. There are approximately 900,000 starseeds on earth today most of them under age 25. We are the bravest of the brave in the most difficult spiritual school in the universe. Earth and our solar system is the center of attention in the universe die to the largest diversity of souls are incarnated here, which means earth has the most Karma tied to it. Potentially mistakes made 54 million years ago are going to be transmuted. We are the creators our current reality is an illusion we must light up the dark places within ourselves. The event will occur followed by mass landings, mentor train by the Ascended Masters and 3 months after the event humans will travel to inner earth to our light chambers to have our frequency rasied. This will only begin after key operations by the light forces all of which are underway, but will not conclude until it is in humanities best interst , meaning that the shift will generate minimal collateral damage. I believe the event is most likely to happen in the spring of eraly summer so minimum of 4 weeks maximum December 2015. Peace Love Unity Victory to the Light!\n\n\nFor reference. ",

Comey got canned because he didn't do shit with declassified docs which were slam dunks for Mossad involvement.\n\nHe was covering asses because the whole purpose of 911 was an excuse for war an to cover up $240 billion in bond fraud which heavily involved Federal Reserve.\n\nShit is going down.\n\nAnd yes, there is a bunch of technology which has been kept from humanity.\n\nExposing this is the way to take these fuckers down for good and break you all out of their magik slave system.\n\n3. \n\nState Department Email\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/37/379092_fw-wtc-i-.html\n\n\nThe $240 billion bond scheme\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/20/207972_-analytical-and-intelligence-comments-it-suggests-that.html\n\nDeclassified FBI material re: Mossad involvement, which Comey did nothing with\n\nhttp://21stcenturywire.com/2015/09/11/911-revisited-declassified-fbi-files-reveal-new-details-about-the-five-israelis/\n\nHow Mossad ran the operation and acted as handlers of the hijackers\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1332210_-analytical-and-intelligence-comments-mossad-ran-9-11-arab.html\n\nWe just prevented a manufactured WWIII by hitting everyone with this at once and vindicating Russia.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\n4. \n\nConsider both positions as possible until we have some confirmation, Anons.\nIf it's for real there will be counter-moves by the various groups that themselves will need countering. I consider it unlikely they didn't have contingency plans.\nIf this is a shill trick it's a good one. Let me break down what I'm seeing. The score, very powerful, exercises the same parts of the brain as sex. Many chemicals! Much joy! This sets the tone for the victory address designed to put us at east, to make us relax and let down our guard.\n\nSTAY FROSTY, ANONS!\nThese are the best of the best psychopaths we're dealing with here. They may at this point even be regarded as a superior species to us. We're supposed to be the cattle but we're waking up.\nEVERYONE STAY AWAKE AND ALERT!\n\n5. \n\nWe're human...but also kind of not.\n\nhttp://www.experiencer.org/the-quantum-hologram-and-the-nature-of-consciousness/\n\nhttps://astronomynow.com/2017/01/22/japanese-spacecraft-spots-planet-spanning-wave-on-venus/\n\nThis \"activated\" most of us by late last year, but there is an adjustment period for when we \"wake up\"...not remembering anything...and have to figure out what is happening.\n\nAs for everything else, Goode and Wilcock are legit.\n\nYes, SSPs exist.\n\nEverything the past 24 hours was a big play to \"end the beginning\" so that the focus can now become explaining an unknown history to humanity, where you come from, who created you, who came to Earth as Prophets, etc.\n\nETIs have been among you a very long time, but multidimensions do exist. Humans are on 3rd, but most ETIs are 4th and up.\n\nDracos are real...and Icke is correct.\n\nYup...crazy world.\n\n6.\n\nLike I said, Dracos exist.\n\n1976 - Diplomatic Cable of Kissinger.\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1976STATE097132_b.html\n\nThe release of this cable predates any mention of the Draco aside from Icke. Spent weeks searching for an alternate attribution, but none was found.\n\nFact is, there has been a galactic war raging for quite some time now, but humanity is near full liberation.\n\nWe figured this would help. Truth sets you free, even when upsetting.\n\n7. \n\nTimeline is on you all.\n\nFirst and foremost, you need to stop being a bunch of petty and racist dicks to one another. Part of it is because you've been manipulated, but you all need to start taking accountability for yourselves and actions.\n\nTesla's theories about energy, frequency, vibration and reverberation thereof impacting future events is 100% correct.\n\nThus, here's a starting point.\n\nRealize that you have been cockroaches, in the grand scheme of thighs, for a very long time and are still here bc benevolent forces finally stepped in on your behalf.\n\nTo start seeing the 4th Dimension, you have to be selfless, kind, merciful, loving, etc.\n\nMany of you are descended from races known as Lyrans, Arcturians, Sirians, and Pleiadians.\n\nI'm of the Pleiades and volunteered with 144,000 others to come down and help you all. What you have to understand is that your body is a vessel which holds consciousness and your consciousness can exist on multiple dimensional planes at once (higher self / lower self). Thus, for 27 years I just went on about my life as normal and then one day...boom! I was activated.\n\nChrist was a Pleiadian.\n\nStratfor dudes laugh, but this email is pretty accurate from what I can both remember and from my research.\n\nhttps://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/16/1696345_fwd-fwd-analytical-and-intelligence-comments-critical.html\n\nOh yeah...Stargates. They exist.\n\n8. \n\nOh trust me, we all go through the doubting period. I went and saw two doctors, clean bill of health, kept looking into Tesla's work and that of Edgar Mitchell.\n\nUsed Wikileaks and CIA databases the past year to piece together bunches of different information and apply to a lens of little known / forgotten history.\n\nIlluminati, Free Masonry, Babylonian Talmudism. Yeah...it's all real.\n\nMaybe a copy will one day be restored to the Library of Congress, but \"Legions of Satan\" (1785) proved to be accurate.\n\nAs for the Draco, google a photo of Queen Victoria and then google a photo of her coffin. HUGE height discrepancy...bc Draco return to normal height upon dying.",

I still feel ashamed when I think about it.** Also, in case it\u2019s of interest, I have since woken up trying to push the bedcovers off my face, and if I do anything that makes me short of breath I find myself clawing at the air with a horrible sensation of smothering and claustrophobia. No doubt this will pass. As if detecting my misery and shame, one of my interrogators comfortingly said, \u201cAny time is a long time when you\u2019re breathing water.\u201d I could have hugged him for saying so, and just then I was hit with a ghastly sense of the sadomasochistic dimension that underlies the relationship between the torturer and the tortured. I apply the Abraham Lincoln test for moral casuistry: \u201cIf slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.\u201d Well, then, if waterboarding does not constitute torture, then there is no such thing as torture.\n\nEmphasis mine. Also-\n\n&gt; It goes without saying that I knew I could stop the process at any time, and that when it was all over I would be released into happy daylight rather than returned to a darkened cell.
