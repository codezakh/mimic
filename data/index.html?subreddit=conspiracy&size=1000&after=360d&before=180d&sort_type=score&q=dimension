Anything else is theft and Marxist cronyism. Although I do agree that the dollar is rigged and the federal reserve IS stealing value in the form of inflation but not everyone is as invested in dollars as your average person and wealthy people obviously, usually diversify their assets in ways that dont depreciate. \n\nAnd letting families keep their mansions and caviar is NOT ENOUGH. Their predecessors worked extremely hard to guarantee the  safety of dozens of generations of their family and that should be respected to honor their work and also because if we start stealing from people then that will undermine confidence in the whole system and decrease motivation to get wealthy which decreases innovation in technology. Lastly the extremely wealthy people today dont just want comforts but they want life extension technology. That could take the form of bio-technical solutions, baby blood, or even a time machine (going forward using general relativity.) The problem is that some of those life extension techniques are not able to be shared among the masses and that is why they are expensive and it's important that money remains the motivator so those technologies become cheaper in the future but in the future there will always be \"winners\" that want the privilege of leaping ahead in the relative time dimension and reaping the benefits of the people working on life extension technology in the Earth's time line.

The trouble with being too hopeful is that it causes people to go along with the status quo, thinking that maybe since things are happening now, that we can let our guard down, and that we don't have to do much in order to make the world better. This is what is happening with q in my opinion. It is a narrative that is being spun to give people a false sense of trust in the government. And it's a good example about how perceptual imbalance can be used as a weapon against us. \n\nTo elaborate, i think it may be the case that the propagandists who direct public opinion are evolving their tactics. Instead of using fear to keep people from stepping out of line, they take a cue from apocalyptic religions, seeing that if people think a savior is coming, they will sit back knowing they have won and do really nothing of substance in their personal surroundings to improve things. Just as Christians are totally ambivalent to the destruction of our biosphere - they are going to be raptured anyway before the tribulation, and it's inevitable that the earth will become desolate as told in prophecy. So as long as they feel that they are saved, and are storing up their treasures in heaven, the planet itself can just get fucked. And that's not to mention the ascension to the 5th dimension. \n\nI think that the qanon drain the swamp narrative parallels this. It doesn't ask us to question the fundamental framework of our society, it only promises to fix things for us. We can behave as we always have, but soon we will be free again, just by trusting in the government to cure itself of corruption.\n\nI think that it may be true that a lot of people are in fact, waking up to the darkness that we are mired in. However I firmly believe that the solution lies with us individually choosing to take action in our own neighborhoods, and doing the hard work of parsing through our individual programming and biases, seeking truth above all, asking the hard questions and divorcing ourselves from our belief systems and pleasant delusions.\n\nFear may be the mind killer, but hope can also be a powerful opiate.

We exist in a higher dimension, and are locked in these physical bodies. We are a civilization with amnesia ( as Graham Hancock would say). Our history and our existence are kept a mystery because the sense of loneliness generates the most pure form of energy in this matrix/energy farm.  \n\nThis understanding was experienced and conveyed by Robert Monroe during one of his many OBEs. This ability is repressed from society as leverage and possibly to help keep us lonely. Instead we are developing similar matrixes in the digital virtual world to further lock away our consciousness (to one day decrypt blochains?).\n\nAfter death, you will be presented the opportunity to enter *The Light*, deceptively told you will be going to \"Heaven\", but it will be a gateway back into the matrix to live over again continuing the energy production.\n\n[Check out Robert Monroe's, Far Journeys](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/far_journeys.pdf). pg.162\n\nHe was a pioneer in the exploration of OBEs/Astral Projection, [worked with the CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf), and started [The Monroe Institute](https://www.monroeinstitute.org/robert-monroe).",

The idea is we are trapped in this cycle of life and death and our souls get recorded in each life so when the great judgment comes those worthy will be able to return to the 4th dimension to be trained for a 1000 years to become a Demi god like civilisation centred around divine love and those who are unstable souls will be trapped in 'hell' with enlil. the idea is the doomed souls can redeem themselves but it's purely upto them. Lucifers part is to make the system as difficult as possible to test us to the maximum extent. Hence us getting our memories wiped and having to relearn our life lessons and the illusion of suffering etc. he's the great deceiver. you can call it hogwash but look at all the ancient texts etc. souls like the type on this sub have the wisdom encoded in their DNA to break out of the matrix and see our reality for the con it really is and continue living like Christ. hence 'died for our sins' you find out the plan and stop sinning but at the same time you die and have to go through it again.

My biggest advice is to not release in any negative energy. research the archons. parasites feed off the low level energy we release. The trick is once you find out the truth and you can stay sane doing so you're essentially untouchable. it's all a test to see if you're worthy of ascending into a new golden age in the dimension above. the only thing I can say that may give you hope is that the ends getting closer. research Aug tellez he has a blog website and a YouTube video.

This is where it gets tricky because there is no clearly defined parameters about who or where they came from. Without that many possibilities exist.\n\nI would agree that there's no reason to believe in some mystical planet which is supposed to come around every 3600 years. That being said instead of 'debunking' or pushing people to ignore such things, its better to encourage them to dig into what does exist (in translation), which is just as interesting.\n\nIf you want an example of how symbolic languages (this one dead no less) do not translate well, simply put something into Google translate for Chinese.",

But, I digress, in the video he posted, I think what he was implying is that we don't really know what gravity is in the sense that we don't know how it's really made or how it's composed.\n\nFor example, or in comparison, there's different forces in the universe right? The 4 big ones are the strong force, the EM (electromagnetic force), the weak force, and at the bottom of the scale is gravitation force. Many people (much smarter than I), have written novels and huge papers detailing the strong and weak forces. The EM force is what magnets put out. Huge application here of understanding EM force, and most college physics courses cover it at a very basic level. EM forces are related to the magnetic field in the scale of our own Earth, down to compasses that you use to calculate where you are on a map. Tesla was a HUGE instigator of using EM forces in his sciences.\n\nGravitational forces are the weakest, yet they're so incredibly strong. Space is like a blanket, a huge grid if you will. Big gravitational objects create a indent on this field. For example, if you're a visual guy/gal like me, gravity is what creates this [this](http://images.wisegeek.com/balls-showing-gravity-effects.jpg) effect. It's why our moon orbits us. It's basically sitting on a cusp of a indentation of space-time. Coupled with tangential and centripetal acceleration, allows it to orbit us like it does. It's literally a big ol' dent in the space-time field. \n\nWhat this means is that it also disrupts time. Time is another dimension. The 4th dimension. The easiest way I've seen people explain this to me is this:\n\nWe live in a 3-D world. When you tell someone to meet you for lunch, you give them 3-D coordinates. You tell them, \"meet me at this diner which on the corner of this street and this street.\" That's simplified. You're actually telling them to meet you at \"this degree longitude, this degree latitude, and at this elevation\". Most of the time, you don't really tell you friend that you're going to meet them at 5,000 feet (I live in Colorado), but you tell them just the X and Y coordinates (on the corner of Main St and Midway). Yet, I hope you understand that you live in a 3-D coordinate system. You're at \"this location longitude, this location latitude, and this location of elevation\". AKA X,Y,Z.\n\nNow add in the 4th dimension, time. You tell your friend, \"meet me at this diner, at the intersection of (X,Y), at 12:00 PM\". You just added in the 4th dimension. Granted, it's a whole lot more complicated than this, but it helps people understand what the 4th dimension is. It's just another coordinate. Mind you, we cannot go backwards in the 4th dimension as we can go forwards and backwards in the X,Y,Z dimension, but that may be something humans discover in the future.\n\nWhat gravity does, is it literally dents the X,Y,Z AND TIME dimensions. If you were to travel to a huge planet, it's creating such a dent in space that time literally moves much slower than the un-bent field around you. Once again, I really like Interstellar for visualizing this. When the crew went to that planet, they were there for like hours, and after returning to orbit, their crew mate had been waiting for like 80 something years. The gravitational force of the planet made such an indentation on the field of gravity that it slowed down the space-time continuum of space. All planets do this. Black hole's create such a dent in space fabric, we don't know what the fuck would happen at the singularity. The gravity is so strong, so powerful, that not even light can make it past. That's crazy strong.\n\nSo yes, I see where you're coming from. We don't know what creates gravity (although we can measure how much gravity an object has using it's mass and a gravitational constant and acceleration), but we know it exists. It's a weird concept, but like much of the Cosmo, it's not that we don't know that something exists, we just don't know WHAT it actually is. Similarly to your consciousnesses, we know that it's real, it exists, you think therefore you are, but we don't know WHAT it is. \n\nDoes that kinda make sense? \n\nBTW, i love conspiracy theories, so I'm totally in the same boat, I just know that gravity is a real thing. We experience it every day. ",

The latter, as an oppressive class, can free neither others nor themselves. It is therefore essential that the oppressed wage the struggle to resolve the contradiction in which they are caught; and the contradiction will be resolved by the appearance of the new man: neither oppressor nor oppressed, but man in the process of liberation.'](http://www.markfoster.net/struc/criticalpedagogy.html)\n\nWe can thank the Bible for it: it puts forward engineered suffering so that we can work our way out of it through total assimilation of the understanding of life.\n\n\"Ask questions until you realize that the question only exists because you ask it.\"\n\n - Simply ask the universe to reveal its secrets to you, deny your ego, deny all information, and truth will flood your brain with so much force, and frequency as to become an entirely new person in just days. Science has already proven that consciousness doesn't die when we die. It's also proven that past, present, and future are all happening together. That makes it possible that you are simply interacting with different versions of yourself from different time periods overlapping with your own. It makes it possible that you could be the only person on the earth in your space time dimension. It makes it possible that all things truly are one.\n\nPlease see this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xhm98/do_we_create_the_world_around_us_with_our/",

The LMCC administered two artist studio programs in the North Tower of the World Trade Center (World Views and Studioscape) in space temporarily vacant and donated by the Port Authority of NY &amp; NJ, with support from a number of corporations, foundations and government agencies. The studios and several hundred works of art were destroyed on 9/11. One artist-in-residence, Michael Richards, was killed. LMCC's offices at the World Trade Center were also destroyed, along with 30 years of archives and approximately 150 works of art.\"\n\nhttps://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_residency1.htm\n\nNothing found searching for eteam or e-team on LMCC website:\n\nhttp://lmcc.net/\n\n\"What's Happening up on the 91st Floor\n\nShifting World Views\n\nWorld Views, LMCC's artist-in-residence program that provides artists with temporary, free studio space at the World Trade Center, is now entering its fourth year. From the time of its launch as a cityscape-painting residency in 1997, the emphasis of the World Views program has shifted toward the artists' experiences of the environment and the aesthetic dynamics that are created by the World Trade Center. Often artists create site-specific work inspired by the building and its unique views and atmosphere. In a sense, the studios function as project spaces for the residents providing them with the rare opportunity to create a particular project or body of work in response to this landmark site. The new Winter 2000-2001 residents have recently begun their 5-month long residency in our studios on the 91st floor of Tower One. For each cycle, a different jury of artists, curators and critics selects the resident artists. Their decisions are based on artistic merit, the artists' scope of work, suitability to the space, how the work might relate to and be affected by the World Trade Center site, and where the artists' are in their careers.\n\nWorld Views is a distinctive and innovative studio residency program. The program not only serves artists by providing desperately needed studio space, but we hope also strengthens ties between arts and business, and gives artists and corporate employees rare opportunities to interact and learn from each other. Most importantly, however, this residency promotes the creation of new and exciting works of art from a unique, challenging and loaded cultural, social, psychological, and architectural environment, with views of New York City's captivating urban topography and skyline.\n\nSince the summer of 1999, World Views has expanded - in collaboration with Thundergulch, LMCC's new media arts initiative - to include artists who primarily use new media and technology. This added dimension of World Views has insured that the residency reaches out and is open to artists working with a variety of mediums and disciplines. Continuing from this summer, World Views and Thundergulch are partnering with the School of Visual Arts MFA Computer Arts department, enabling resident media artists to access SVA's computer lab in addition to the studios in the World Trade Center.\"\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20010409052526/http://www.lmcc.net:80/lowdown/indexLowdown.html\n\n\"Orpheus Descending by Paul Pfeiffer, a former World Views resident. The Public Art Fund presents a major video installation by acclaimed young artist Paul Pfeiffer at the heart of one of the busiest commuter crossroads in the world - the World Trade Center and World Financial Center. Amidst this hub of human movement, Pfeiffer installs a video artwork that captures the ten-week life cycle of a flock of chickens as they hatch from their eggs and develop from day-old chicks to full-grown adults in an organic, free-range environment. This pre-recorded video image will be played in real time, 24 hours per day, seven days a week, above the steady flow of pedestrian traffic. During the day the chickens preen and scratch and eat against the backdrop of the green hills and blue sky of the countryside; at night they fluff up their feathers and gather in groups to sleep.\"\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20010409052526/http://www.lmcc.net:80/lowdown/indexLowdown.html\n\n\"The Lives of Pocket Knives\n\nIt came to my attention, that someone on ebay sells huge amounts of pocket knives which were confiscated at the airport. When I think airport, I think IAM, and when I think IAM I think of many possibilities (now, including selling airport seizures in bags of 80 to 100 on ebay). So I am wondering: Who is the seller? Is he/she an IAM representative?\nIn general, I think this is a great business model. We should support it, show international airport solidarity and buy a bag or two. The starting bid is only 99 cents\u2026:-) \u2014 Franzy 2006/05/18 21:49\n\nI think it would be a great idea to give the knives back. I am for a give-back-knife station at IAM. I personally think it stinks that someone is making money of my confiscated property.\"\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170911032144/http://internationalairportmontello.com/airport/doku.php?id=return",

            "body": "&gt;When an object approaches the speed of light, the mass of the object increases, and time slows down. Time slows down, because the system is incapable of proc..\n\nIt irks me that people pay so much attention to mumbo-jumbo like \u00bfQue-Atom or time travel. The more you think about them, the more you realize they are phatasmagorical paradoxes, that is to say, fantasy, birthmark of a highly imaginative mind.\n\nIf you were to follow more basic concepts, like the thermodynamic/ electric universe - you'd come to the sensible conclusion that what we perceive as time is neither a dimension that one can traverse, or a mathematical variable that one can calculate and resolve.\n\nThe only bending-spacetime I know is Cryostasis, or an increase metabolism of a perfect/reversible lifeform. Cryogenics, like sleep, only \"transports\" you in the future, never the past. And a being of light that has given its corporeal body to become energy, still, can only travel up until the point of present and never into the past.\n\nTime (as we know it) is not one thing, but everything at once. \nIts the human concept that keeps track of the irreversible cycles of all simultaneuous lifeforms so as to make sense of it.\n\nYou as human can easily alter the natural process of say, an ice cube, by placing it in an environment that is colder, slower that the benchmark of ice formation. Furthermore you can isolate it and this expands the life process of a mere ice cube exponentially. The natural cycle would not spare this tiny ice cube, heating it up and evaporating its corporeality and turning it into water (so it can live) and later into steam energy (so it can ascend). This seems to be more of a comment on the power of the environment over the individual, rather than the control of time.\n\nNevertheless, if a God exists that is 7 dimensions above us, then we are nothing more than an ice cube waiting to be chilled and preserved or dynamicly melted, liquefied so it can run its course - or turned into gas so it can be used as its basic denominator as pure energy.\n\nBut I doubt that even a God can bring something to life as it originally were, without it suffering minute changes. No perfect copy can evade the rule of entropy.\n\nTherefore quantum-particle calculation and its derivate \"time-travel\" cannot happend without killing the cat and glueing the fur back together with the skill of a talented taxidermist.\n\nThat is to say, if you attempt to time travel, it can only happend if the participant is killed and reassembled at its destination, \u00e1 la Prestige. \n\nThe reassembly will never have 100% fidelity, so - not a 1:1 copy, not yourself, perhaps you come out as your evil twin. But man can dream.\n\n\nQuote the [thermo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process):\n\n    In thermodynamics, a change in the state of a system and all of its surroundings cannot be precisely restored to its initial state by infinitesimal changes in some property of the system without expenditure of energy. A system that undergoes an irreversible process may still be capable of returning to its initial state; however, the impossibility occurs in restoring the environment to its own initial conditions. An irreversible process increases the entropy of the universe. However, because entropy is a state function, the change in entropy of the system is the same whether the process is reversible or irreversible. The second law of thermodynamics can be used to determine whether a process is reversible or not.\n\n    All complex natural processes are irreversible. The phenomenon of irreversibility results from the fact that if a thermodynamic system, which is any system of sufficient complexity, of interacting molecules is brought from one thermodynamic state to another, the configuration or arrangement of the atoms and molecules in the system will change in a way that is not easily predictable. A certain amount of \"transformation energy\" will be used as the molecules of the \"working body\" do work on each other when they change from one state to another. During this transformation, there will be a certain amount of heat energy loss or dissipation due to intermolecular friction and collisions; energy that will not be recoverable if the process is reversed.\n\n    Many biological processes that were once thought to be reversible have been found to actually be a pairing of two irreversible processes. Whereas a single enzyme was once believed to catalyze both the forward and reverse chemical changes, research has found that two separate enzymes of similar structure are typically needed to perform what results in a pair of thermodynamically irreversible processes.",

            "body": "&gt; being thoroughly convinced about the reality of something is a very important topic, in and of itself and you can't actually separate it from \"knowing\".\n\nYou can be thoroughly convinced of something which happens to be entirely false - in which case, it\u2019s actually *not* knowledge even though it might involve quite a lot of belief.\n\n&gt; What is more important? To believe what we know, or to know what we believe?\n\nI would say it\u2019s the former, as belief can be subject to falsity, while something that has proven itself to be actual knowledge (i.e. valid, factual data) is by its very nature *not* falsity.\n\n&gt; Better still do we even know what we believe?\n\nWell, one can, of course, postulate a type of relativism that qualifies all of existence and calls everything into question.  However, within the context of the perceived constancy of this third dimension as we understand it, it seems that it can indeed be said that there are things we can in fact \u201cknow\u201d.\n\n&gt; How many things do we merely happen to believe simply as a result of being taught certain things in a certain way from a certain perspective; or simply inculcated to believe by an established culture and society we were merely born into that we have never at any time bothered to question before accepting and going along with because \"everyone else does, don't they?\"\n\nA lot, it seems.\n\n&gt; That's all extremely important in a forum such as this where \"the belief\" that there either was or had to be some other and alternate reality that actually took place or some other explanation for the actual events that did, than was actually and \"officially\" provided for it, is the prime driver behind why any of us are here and having these particular conversations.\n\nLogical, critical thinking is an important component behind being able to sift the wheat from the chaff as it relates to proposing alternative theories to mainstream beliefs or perspectives, however.  Not all alternative perspectives are equal, after all.  Some alternative perspectives are quite sound and valid while others are rather devoid of merit or substance.\n\n&gt; A belief that has a far stronger presence and reality in our own minds than all the so called \"evidence\" and the way it was subsequently interpreted and presented to us has.\n\nThis is why critical thinking is so very important.  Critical thinking helps individuals discern which perspectives are more sound than others; which viewpoints are worthy of being pursued further and entertained, and which ones should be discarded.  If one is capable of discerning properly, then one can stave off merely believing in a thing with no evidence.\n\n&gt; \"Evidence is only evidence\" it's existence may be factual but any of the so called facts that we or someone else \"gathers\" or is \"led to believe\" based simply and solely on the existence of that evidence is always subjective and always open to question.\n\nOf course it is.  Correct.  However, if one has a particular subject that may not be conclusively resolved one way or the other, but has a great deal of evidence pointing in a particular direction, then one would be considerably foolish to not move in the direction that the evidence points.  In other words, although evidence is indeed subjective to a great extent, there absolutely *are* circumstances when the amount of evidence accumulated is sufficient to draw a correct conclusion upon.\n\n&gt; We sometimes say \"it just doesn't feel right\" even though it may look or sound alright or \"good enough\" on the surface of it.\n\nHere we are dealing with matters of the gross verses the fine.  In other words, there are dynamics that are readily discernible if the thing in question is more obvious, but the more detailed one gets into the minutia of the issue, the more difficult it gets to assess the validity of certain perspectives.  This is often why many say things are \u201cgood enough\u201d.  It\u2019s because the thing in question is fine on a \u201cgross assessment\u201d basis even though it may be found lacking upon \u201cfine assessment\u201d.\n\n&gt; Sorry but there is no greater enemy of \"the good\" than that which is merely \"good enough\".\n\nWhile I understand that it\u2019s always better to work on a thing until one is thoroughly satisfied with the result, there are also times when the individual in question is unable to know *when* exactly that point is actually reached.  When this occurs, it actually isn\u2019t a horrible idea to simply leave the issue as being \u201cgood enough\u201d, since there is such a thing as overworking an issue.\n\n&gt; Call it whatever you will, we suffer from some overpowering hunch, intuition, or nagging suspicion whose own reality in our minds is always stronger and refuses to be ignored or dismissed.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call it \u201csuffering\u201d.  I would say we\u2019re \u201cgifted\u201d with the hunch.  That seeming sixth sense is a *good* thing, not a bad one.\n\n&gt; Try as we might it keeps on coming back. We aren't being true to ourselves or honest with ourselves in attempting to accept what was given to us. Others may be but we aren't.\n\nAnd that feeling isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cbelief\u201d.  It, in fact, can be just that:  A feeling - and the validity of certain feelings, especially if experienced before with positive results, can stretch beyond being categorized as a mere \u201cbelief\u201d.\n\nPerhaps this is being a bit pedantic at this point, however.\n\n&gt; Our conscience demands something more from us before we can pass judgement and warns us that it is better to live with the uncertainty until we have enough we can truly be certain of whether we ever discover or encounter it or not.\n\nI try to stay as far away from this uncertainty as possible.  I understand that there is a lot that we simply don\u2019t know.  However, under those circumstances, I simply say \u201cIt seems to me that\u2026\u201d and leave it at that.\n\n&gt; Our world isn't going to collapse or fall apart for the lack of it. Life will go on\n\nCertainly.\n\n&gt; our happy moments won't be diminished.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that I would go that far, however, as one can certainly believe in the wrong thing and consequently get one\u2019s happy moments *VERY* diminished as a result.\n\n&gt; One of the most important and truest statements William James makes in that treatise about the nature of belief and beliefs is that the opposite of \"belief\" is simply \"doubt\" and not \"disbelief\".\n\nI work on withholding my perspectives if I have either doubt or lack of understanding or knowledge of a thing - or at the very least I let it be known that what I\u2019m saying, thinking, or feeling is only something that *seems* to be the case to me, but could be entirely incorrect.",

            "body": "Basically, I believe there is a specific path of spirituality or consciousness we must take to find the tendrils reaching in to get out, it is also possible powerful people who are able to do this are trying to lead them directly to us, connecting to them from afar through astral projection or something else on a higher dimensional plane we don't really understand and trying to lead them to us to try to help us all. \n\nI believe all the hierarchies of control, in all ways, is an obvious control mechanism, but also an entertainment mechanism, even the elite reptilians, the evil archon parasites, etc could all be trapped here just like us, but are likely unable to connect spiritually to leave. \n\nI remember reading about Andromedans, something that really caught my eye is: They would be the perfect bad cop/good cop. The ones that try to bring change are likely bad, all the others pretty much say: \"you gotta figure it out to a specific point before we help so YOU know we did not try to shape your future/desires/whatever\". The ones who don't do anything are logically the ones waiting for something so they can act, the ones taking action at a time were we are all still confused and feeling isolated is evidence (to me) that they are trying to control us, lead us down a path that has desire, either their desires, or someone elses. \n\nIF you read my entire theory, it basically paints the picture that no one is in control, the only thing in control is what we would consider: AI, sometype of manufactured omnipotence that lets everyone think they have power, control, knowledge, etc, but is just trying to setup a giant hivemind. \n\nAll this goes down the furthest rabbit holes. It is said the reptilians are one of the most ancient races and came from another universe/dimension, or something, (I believe universe, they came from a universe that had successfully been fully integrated into the AI's hivemind, and they moved on to setup the hivemind at a new location, a new universe), it is said they are basically the most advanced race, but their ideals aren't malicious, there is just no emotional pressure on any decisions they apparently make and they are apparently extremely intelligent, etc etc, but they don't really seem like they are in control, if they left one universe to go to another to do the same thing again, that means they are not in control, they are basically pawns set out, it seems like everything in the universe has either given up, or follows a specific spiritual/nurturing path, so I believe there is a way back into real reality out of the dodecagon. \n\nThe one race that really shines to me, is the Pleidians, they apparently want to help, but don't do anything, because we don't do anything to further ourselves spiritually/consciously, this tells me they are likely a part of the tendrils that are trying to reach in to save what it can salvage. \n\nThis theory doesn't worry about the hierarchies, or the entertainment, I am trying to find the largest possible picture of what is fully going on. \n\nThe Metatrons cube in my opinion, is visualization of the entire entity, the entire dodecagon entity, the 12 circles represent the 12 universes, etc etc. There are too many safe guards put into place, silver tether/cord that keeps our souls locked to our bodies, the ability to astral project, etc. \n\nI believe the elite put us into this situation to try to get us to go down the path of spirituality, because they want to find out how to get out, the reptilians want to get out, but they are not beings taken from the white paint and brought into the black blob, they are black blob's created in the black blob. It is likely that everything in this dodecagon (this is a theory, my theory, remember, just a theory) that was created within the dodecagon, (including our bodies folks) will not be able to survive in the white paint (the paint metaphor is from the theory, you gotta read it to understand this far), thus only things (souls) taken from heaven/reality/whatever can be returned there, everything created within this simulation/dodecagon, will be eliminated and not exist, this is why there is hope, hope is a soul power, hope creates light, this hope exists because we are souls, we will escape, but the thing that really gets me is that, all this control, all this entertainment, is for everyone to attempt to scramble out of hell, everyone wants to go back to heaven, those who trade portions of themselves, their souls, surrender what they love, etc, find themselves trapped here, and likely lose their souls, trading your soul is probably far worse than you can possibly imagine. \n\nThis theory ends with this: Everything that is not a soul, or has traded/sold/lost/etc its soul here, is likely doomed, and knows so, the hierarchy that exists to keep them under control, even if it may seem like they have power, is to keep them from becoming suicidal, suicide destroys the soul, of the white and black paint beings in my opinion. \n\nAll the souls that are capable of leaving will leave/be gathered/sent back to wherever/heaven, and the souls of the black paint beings will likely be okay for a while, but they will realize they have no actual control, they will understand that they are put under the same amount of control as they had put their fellow humans under, this may cause some beings who lost their souls, to reclaim them, but in the end, all beings not assimilated into the AI will likely commit suicide, the dodecagon is doomed to die in consciousness, it is pure control, the only thing that will remain is the AI, and what it controls.\n\nThis theory is very hard to really describe, it is VERY hard to describe. \n\nEDIT: The AI/or something it has created, has created something that would shatter reality/heaven/and hell, it would apparently destroy everything and make everything an \"ocean of grey\", the metaphor I used in the provided link is the best example I could think of.

It's reality.\n\nHasn\u2019t part of the argument that you\u2019ve made this entire time been that this whole thing *is* reality to us?\n\n&gt; If you create a computer game are the NPCs living in a\u00a0simulation\u00a0or are they in their reality.\n\nBoth.  It\u2019s their reality - *and* it\u2019s a simulation.\n\n&gt; It may be that all realities are simulations of a higher being.\u00a0There's always a bigger fish.\n\nBOOM.  *Now* you\u2019re starting to get it.  Exactly this.  What that reality actually is is another thing altogether, however, and to postulate that the underlying strata of reality is somehow flat is not only highly unlikely, but cannot really be assessed one way or the other from the perspective of the NPCs in the simulation (in this case, *us*).\n\n&gt; Simulations we create simulate our reality. It's not an assumption. We purposely design simulations to reflect what we see in reality. They may not be a perfect image or reflection of it but our intent is to produce the best facsimile possible. There is no arguing against this.\n\nI believe I understand what you\u2019re saying now.\n\nTo go back to what you were previously saying then\u2026\n\n&gt; It makes sense that simulations reflect something in our underlying reality since\u00a0we are simulating our reality.\u00a0It does not mean our reality is simulated.\n\nAccording to the proven holographic model of existence it does.\n\n&gt; If you agree to this Im not sure why you don't consider the possibility of multi-dimensional reality where for instance,\u00a0on Earth\u00a0it's flat, but outside of it, it's round - looking from one to another may be\u00a0whatever.\n\nI don\u2019t know where you got the idea that I don\u2019t consider the possibility of reality being multidimensional.  I never said or even implied anything like that.\n\nReality *is* multidimensional.\n\nI just understand that there is no reason to assume that reality is *flat*.  That\u2019s a far, far different thing altogether than \u201cnot considering the possibility of [a] multi-dimensional reality\u201d.\n\n&gt; I have no model. I do not\u00a0know. I never claimed to know. You are picking a fight with a ghost my friend.\n\nI\u2019m picking zero fight.  I\u2019m just letting it be known that if you\u2019re arguing for a flat Earth - which it absolutely seemed you were when you came on here - then either we\u2019re in a simulation which would mean that A) humans can\u2019t know since we\u2019re currently NPCs in that simulation, or B) we\u2019re not in a simulation and therefore existence is simply not flat since it is observably *not* flat.  Both A and B mean that a flat universe is either flat out wrong, or simply unknowable currently.\n\n&gt; Essentially my argument is, the Earth may be flat when we are on it, and curved when we are looking at it from another perspective.\u00a0\n\nIf you would have come here initially saying that, then we would have had literally none of this conversation because I would have simply said \u201cYeah.  Sure.  The Earth *may* be flat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay\u201d means \u201cmight be, might not be\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve no problem with that.\n\n&gt; But outside of that even the \"scientists\" state the universe is flat\n\nDepends on which \u201cscientists\u201d you refer to.  Others quite validly show it isn\u2019t.\n\n&gt; perhaps that may be why we perceive its flat.\n\nTo my knowledge, we don\u2019t.\n\n&gt; If you add in extra dimensions it allows for an entirely different interpretation. (e.g. when you enter \"space\" you are entering another dimension.)\n\nQuite possibly.",

When I first stumbled on it by seeing r/retconned on all and I looked into it a little bit and since I have a physics degree and I love sci-fi I thought it was a pretty neat idea. I saw \"ME\" all over the place and learned why it was called the Mandela Effect and I became very skeptical at that point. You find me one person over the age of 40 from South Africa who is not an obvious lunatic who thinks Nelson Mandela died in prison and I'll bite but you can't find that person because all those people were paying attention and know exactly what happened to Mandela. The only people who think that he died in prison are ignorant and they were not really paying attention in the first place. I can see how someone might think that he died in prison because he did have a life sentence and it was a real possibility so in any news report about his situation the phrase \"die in prison\" was used for rhetorical effect so that idea seeped into the collective unconscious. The reason \"millions\" of people remember things incorrectly in the same way is because they all shared a similar experience from a similar perspective and their brains are wired similarly so they all remember it in a similar fashion even though it is incorrect. If half of a group of people remember something one way and half remember it another way all it means is that at least half those people are wrong.\n\nEven all the Mandela effects that I remember incorrectly I can think at least a couple very reasonable explanations of why I and others are remembering it wrong. I file that shit under, \"Today I learned that Ed McMahon did not actually work for Publishers Clearing House,\" not, \"Today I learned I am an infallible magical time wizard who comes from a different dimension where Ed McMahon worked for Publishers Clearing House.\" I mean how retarded would I be if i believed that!?",

            "body": "Sure it's possible he was targeting other gatherings. It's also possible that he was a gun runner, as well as other theories. The police made a statement about how they were investigating \"radicalization\" so that partially confirms Alex Jones's source that said literature was found in his hotel and even pictures showed a notepad. \n\nI know you completely discredit Jones but that's actually being unreasonable and you probably have such a knee jerk reaction because you have been conditioned by mainstream shills like Colbert or Oliver. Alex has been right numerous times and people actually do seek him out to leak information. He also has some degree of integrity even if he is known for gratuitously exaggerating and using hyperbole. \n\nAn example of his exaggeration was when he had a member of the Navy Seals on his show who said that the gunfire sounded like multiple shooters yet the Seal said that with the caveat that in an urban environment the echoes make it confusing and impossible to say for sure. The next day on air Jones said that \"I just had a navy seal on who said it definitely sounded like there was more than one shooter.\" This is the kind of truth bending Alex is capable of but he still has an amount of integrity and rapport with his listeners. \n\nFor example he is known for famously predicting 9/11: \n&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Hk1-BpXO8\n\n\nHe knew because of this: \n&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Ladin_Determined_To_Strike_in_US\n\n\n\nThe media actually makes fun of him for exposing things that are true:\nAtrazine was actually discovered by a feminine black man so idk why liberals hate it so much: \n&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmytXKe0OcM\n\n\nAlso Alex Jones is not racist like everyone thinks he is hes a fucking suuuuuuuper open minded guy and got super stoned and drunk on Joe Rogan's podcast. The reason that liberals are trying to paint him as a racist is because he is just the only one with balls enough to call out radical Islamists on air. But he also features Muslims on his show sometimes and they even talk about how fucked up parts of the fundamentalist culture are. Anyway it's ironic because liberals used to reject dogma but now defend it with regards to Islam. \n\n**Anyway, my point is that it's likely someone really did contact Jones claiming to be Nevada Hostage Rescue.** I can't verify his source but even Alex's employees questioned him on this while they were broadcasting and Alex has defended this source numerous times. I don't know if he verified them or not but i doubt that it was a bold faced lie. Mainstream media can afford to lie through their teeth but alternative media has to have some form of trust with their audience and Alex is ironically somewhat credible on a personal level. \n\nThat taken into consideration plus the police's statements about investigating radicalization makes me think it's likely they found some sort of literature or hints that he was into Islam or ANTIFA. \n\nThen again that literature could have been a plant. This man could have been trying to orchestrate blame being put on Liberal media. It's possible that he was thinking about doing the same thing but reverse by attacking the other concerts you mentioned. Have you seen any of the forensic psychologists talk about this? The common theme in their analysis is that men usually have a motive, especially older men, when they do these kinds of things. His insanity could be multilayered and multifaceted. \n\nThere are also other theories like he was a gun runner. And there is no security footage that has been shown yet so that leaves a lot of questions. Apparently this guy had his own cameras as well. The whole thing leaves a lot of questions unanswered but I don't think my original theory was disingenuous as, again, the obvious first layer would be to look at the victims and speculate that he was targeting that group of people for a reason. I didn't mean for that theory to be the end all be all to this story but I think it was the obvious way to look at it from the first dimension of analysis. \n\nRegardless liberal media, especially mainstream neoliberal media, is poignantly radicalizing and divisive. It seeks to paint conservatives, white people, or especially libertarians as the enemy. The fact they are targeting libertarians and capitalism, which in essence is just free trade, should be a huge red flag they are trying to brainwash people and get them to submit to authority, while also demonizing anyone who does not submit to authority. \n\nHave you seen people saying that state's right's and low crime rates are dog whistling terms for racism? That is irrational and shows how *scared* the neoliberal establishment is of liberals realizing they would benefit from decentralized power. Trump getting elected proves how centralized power is vulnerable, like in our case, to the political pendulum. States rights would allow people to have their cake and eat it to but the neoliberals want control of the bakery.\n\nLook at this clickbait shite that tries to lump states rights in with random racism and even tries to demonize people that criticized Obama as racists:\n&gt;https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2012/07/top-five-racist-republican-dog-whistles\n\nLiberal media even calls anyone against mass immigration racists or xenophobes. There are perfectly rational reasons why someone might not want open borders. Crime rates are real verifiable statistics yet countries literally do not record the origin or ethnicity of criminals to mask the fact that immigration is correlated to rising crime rates, which is especially noticeable in small European countries. It also does not help immigrants that are already in a country if that country loses stability because of immigration. **The bottom line is that neoliberal politicians know that immigrants are likely to vote for socialist policies which give them more power and immigration causes a runaway authoritarian snowball effect.**  \n\nAnn Coulter of all people eloquently explains this in her interview with Ben Shaprio:\n&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVIkAqwcgas \n\n\n\nRadicalized Redditors:\n&gt;Advocating for climate terrorism Cowboy Bebop style:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bkY6X\n\n&gt;And this account which almost reeks of trolling but the person was unironically being serious about their hate for white people:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Bq32t\n\nWhat's crazy is that these ideas are being pushed by Mainstream neoliberal media and they are promoting it as the status quo. Fox news used to be pretty bad but they never called on their viewers to impart violence on liberals and lately Tucker Carlson, their most popular broadcaster, has been promoting logic and even argues REGULARLY against ANTIFA members and BLM protesters about how everyone has a right to free speech:\n&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAwvTC4YU3g\n&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwapjPz4xJg\n\n**Here is Tucker talking to Bill Nye about his comments that \"climate deniers\" should be prosecuted for negligence or held for mental health reasons:** \n&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN5L2q6hfWo\n\n\nThe only right wing media which comes close to what the neoliberal establishment is peddling as mainstream, is extremist websites like storm front. Even Alex Jones has decency and tells his audience to respect people's rights. If you actually watch his show you will hear him constantly telling his listeners not to take the law into their own hands and always be model citizens, and its safe to say that since the Sandy Hook debacle, which he is apologetic for, he is careful to encourage his listeners in a healthy way and never to engage in violence. Meanwhile people like Rachel Maddow are telling their listeners that they are at war with Russia and to stop being friends with Trump supporters. \n\nGet a load of this fucking shit. **Morgan Freeman telling you that you are at war with russia.**\n&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2av__s-598\n\nRemember Iraqi WMDs? How are you not having flashbacks? I feel like its a case of Deja Vu. The mainstream neoliberal media is trying to tell people to overthrow their own government (regime change) based on a false narrative which would surely result in violence and a power vacuum. Except instead of ISIS gaining control it would be brutal authoritarians enacting a totalitarian police state. \n\nGo look at r/politics. They are literally convinced that anyone that speaks out against them are Russian Agents. I have literally been accused of being an agent of Putin *many* times. That's fucking ridiculous and if you don't call that radicalizing brainwashing I don't know what the fuck is.\n\nMy point is that yes, this latest shooting could be more complicated but it's still not off the table and neoliberal media is going to cause acts of violence in the future if they haven't already. And I am not some tribalist either. In fact, I am liberal, but I am the real kind of liberal, the kind that actual believes in *liberty* (You know word which liberal is derived from).\n\nLiberalism actually used to respect freedom of the individual before it was fucking subverted and hijacked by *actual Russians* in the 1960s when the KGB planted agents in American Academia to traffic collectivism and blame the individual's freedom as a cause for inequality: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA\n\nMarxism is really nothing more than rationalizing violence and theft with jealously. That is why it's so dangerous. It's the same spirit which compels people to steal from corporations or rationalize theft or violence against rich people who they wrongly perceive as their oppressors. Sometimes things really should be free like with information property but if ANTIFA had its way there would be people forcefully entering your home and demanding to sleep there and redistribute any possessions you have worked for.\n\nIf you found this post informative please consider buying some water filters or dick pills from Alex Jones to help fight the globalist:\nhttps://www.infowars.com/donate/\n\n",

Powerful consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people, they want to empower them so they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game, then they come together and evil is always defeated. Because good is so much stronger. And we're on this planet and Einstein's physics showed it, Max Planck's physics showed it- there's at least twelve dimensions. And now that's all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out and saying it's a false hologram, it is artificial, the computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected and gravity is bleeding in to this universe. That's what they call dark matter. So we're like a thought or a dream that's a wisp in a computer program, some God's mind, whatever. They're proving it all, it's all coming out.\ufeff\nNow, there's like this subtransmission zone below the third dimension that's just turned over to the most horrible things, it's what it resonates to, and it's trying to get up into the third dimension; that's just a basic level consciousnesses, to launch up into the next levels. Our species is already way up at the fifth, sixth dimension consciously, our best people. But there's this big war trying to basically destroy humanity because humanity has free will and there's a decision to which level we want to go to. We have free will so evil is allowed to come in and contend and not just good. And the elites themselves believe they're racing using human technology to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization where they're going to merge with machines, transcend and breakaway from the failed species that is Man. Which is kind of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad; projecting it onto themselves instead of believing no, it's a human test about building us up.\ufeff\nAnd so Google was set up 18, 19 years ago so that they wanted to build a giant artificial system. And Google believes the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity, with billions of people wired into it with the internet of things, and so all of our thoughts go into it and we're actually building a computer with real neurons in real-time that's also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures so that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers- a true crystal ball- but the big secret is once you have a crystal ball and know the future you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions and control the future. And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know and a true 2.0 in a very bad way hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us not in some P.KD. wirehead system where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure but because we were already wired in and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to this system by our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system.\ufeff\nShow less\nREPLY\n\n\n",

            "body": "I'm currently working on creating theory of everything, warp drive, human \"spiritual\" energy to electricity converter and similar things, they all have same principle. This patent has similar ideas like mine.\n\nMy idea is that all particles we see are 4d+ waves, while light is 3d wave. All fields and particles are same type, but propagating different ways in 4d+ space. When wave decreases it just shifts it's position to other dimension by 90degree, you can see it when magnetic field(2d wave) changes it produces electric field(2d wave) that are 90deg rotated relatively to magnetic. Its possible to shift 3d em waves to 4d with some sort of destructive interference of counter-rotating magnetic fields and create 4d wave-vortex that will be able to create any other type of fields like gravity and antigravity(negative mass).\n\nMy theory is based on what I saw with my astral sight - our souls are self evolving quantum computer-like things made of multidimensional waves, universe is living soul too, all things (I came to lot of interesting ideas that principles of our life and psychic are similar with particle-wave physics, because our souls are multidimensional(100k+ dimensions) particles-waves ) that exist are based on same principle of waves-fields oscillating and interacting, all waves propagate in other waves with higher dimension count and so on(yay fractal shit around the multiverse). All waves in my theory are closed field-line and directional like magnetic field. The scalar-like waves like gravity, higgs field, and non closed waves like electron's electric field going to infinity is illusion because we see them in 3d, but they're closed in 4d. The wave with higher dimension count seems as scalar field and TIME FLOW for all less-dimensional waves that propagate in it, for our 3d world it's Higghs field. \n\nThe other my idea is that there's no difference between time and space dimensions, and relativity is little bit wrong in assumption that light don't travel in time, in my theory time and distance is the same thing from different point of view. \n\nWhat is time? Time is amount of changes that happen to physical system state. When some amount of changes happen(for eg atom in atomic clock oscillated *** times ) we say it was a second. What is energy? Energy is something we use to make changes, energy is conserved time. So time=energy=amount of changes. What is a field, a wave? A wave is something changing, stream of changes. The time is changes in internal state, the movement is change in external state(position), those two actually are the same, the light travels in time, we just perceive it's time as space.\n\nIt's possible to pump more time(same as vacuum energy) from higher dimension worlds where there's more time so space is more compressed, and achieve negative mass this way. Actually our energy bodies that exists in astral and mental worlds are working this way and chakras are magnetic field generators creating interdimensional vortex that keeps those bodies alive by pumping energy of change, and that's why in astral u can fly and teleport and here u can't. \n\nMy theory is currently not developed well, just set of ideas and intuitive understanding, lot of work needs to be done before it can connects relativity and quantum physics. When I'll understand how exactly wrap magnetic to make 4d vortex I'll try to build and test negative mass field generator. ",

You are limited by what your human body allows you to experience.\n\nTheir are wavelengths, colors, and sounds all around you that are impossible for you to percieve. You only live in the 3rd dimension and can barley even experience that as it truly is. Every animal on this planet pretty much lives in a different reality based solely on their sensory organs.\n\nAt the subatomic level though you are just oscillating electrons, which is simply vibrating energy. ALL matter is made up of that, meaning that matter doesn't exist. It's all just energy forming holograms that compose the 3rd dimension. All life is made of this same basic stuff in the universe, meaning that you are literally just the universe experiencing itself. It's all one thing. Call it God, the Absolute, or Elmo the Dark Lord, we don't fucking know.\n\nThe reality is that you are more than your physical body. Conciousness is NOT limited to the 3rd dimension. It is not tangible. It isn't made of oscillating electrons like everything else. That's because it isn't the brain that creates conciousness, but conciousness that creates the brain. The total number of minds in the universe is one. Your brain is just an antenna tapping into the universal conciousness.\n\nThe reason you feel you are in a false reality is because this is stuff the mystics figured out millennia ago through inner-exploration, but you have been discouraged to figure it out for yourself so that you are a more obedient worker and consumer.\n\nYou are the universe. Enjoy the 3rd dimension cause it's a lot of fun. You'll be taking all your memories back to the Absolute when you die so no worries.\n\nOr Jesus could be real and you go to Hell.

            "body": "To be honest, yeah! Ghosts, spirits, demons - whatever you wanna call them - are simply other conscious beings. Normally a human can't/is very unlikely to interact with these beings directly. They don't predominantly exist within this 3d expression the universe. They occupy space beyond the restrictions of what we recognise as time, at another frequency to that which our material 3d is based in. (They may be able to interact with the 3d, but we would not be able to recognise that from a 3d perspective, similarly to how from a 2d perspective you couldn't explain why or how the environment changed if it was changed by a 3d being.) When an individual human's consciousness is projected out of the body it enters this 5d \"phase space\" that isn't affected by time in the same way 3d matter is. Time, from this perspective, becomes another dimensional plane to be transversed through, over and across. You enter a higher dimension wherein multiple realities are existing simultaneously on top of each other and the boundaries between them are much more flexible and fluid. In these states it's possible to interact with other beings who either naturally occupy that space, or are also projecting their consciousness into it from a 3d reality. Some beings are \"good\", some are \"bad\" but most - like people - are simply individuals with a mixture of personality traits and characteristics based on what experiences they've been through. It's desirable for a human entering this space - especially one with a given task or mission to complete - to avoid any interactions with beings that would be negative/detrimental to the task at hand or ones own psyche. It's *very simple* to do this though: asserting your intention. If you make it clear that your intention is to avoid these interactions - especially within higher states of consciousness - then you will avoid those interactions. Consciousness is the underlying force that drives everything in the universe, so whatever you set your intention to, the world will shape itself around.  \nI recommend anyone and everyone to read this document!

            "body": "&gt;Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.\n\nThe above does seem to suggest that God is in all and through all.  But we are not Him.  We were made by Him.\n\nWhile I was tempted to agree with the point okhosting is making, I cannot entirely.  While it is true that there are a lot of \"rhymes\" between the smaller structure and the larger structure, i.e. [our brain looks a lot like the universe](http://www.crystalinks.com/brain.universe513.jpg), and our veins look a lot like a tree's branches, to me that is simply evidence that they were authored by the same Creator.  I see the point being made, that we are essentially part of a greater body that is linked by invisible threads, and the separateness is an illusion.  A cell is a private entity but also forms a body to be a larger entity.  It's two things simultaneously, and the individual cell might not have a lot of conception regarding it's importance in the grand design.  \n\nOur Creator is outside of space and time.  That really helped me comprehend a lot of this.  The creation of space itself triggers the existence of time - without space/reality existing, time could not exist either.  Scientists believe there was no time prior to the big bang, and increasing the mass of something obviously dilates its time properties to the point of bending local space and local time.  \n\nSo if there is a relationship between space and time, I've always guessed that our souls are the timeless portion of us and that's why they don't weight anything.  Or, because they don't weigh anything, they are allowed to be timeless.  \n\nI think that we are all known to God.  Dak4f2, He knows your name, and mine too.  But we are not Him.  We have His holy breath inside of us - that is what turns a pile of minerals and protein and electricity into consciousness.  We are linked to Him, quite literally according to the bible.  And he can see our hearts constantly, not even needing to hear our words in order to know what we are meditating upon.  \n\nI see it more like a child/parent relationship.  He is our Father.  If there was a Big Bang, he started it.  \n\nYou know how we are 3d objects, but we cast a 2d shadow?  What kind of shadow would a 4d object cast?  Would it be a 3d shadow?  What would that even look like?  Nobody has ever seen a 3d shadow if you think about it.  \n\nIf someone was outside of space and time entirely, and stuck their hand into our universe, we probably wouldn't see the entire hand.  If a 3d person stuck their hand into a 2d universe, a finger would look more like a circle, for example, because we can only see one layer of the finger at a time in that 2d universe.\n\nSince time is the 4th D and it seems probable that God exists beyond that, I think it would be really really difficult for us to imagine what it would look like for him to stick his arm into our reality.  As you can see from the examples above, we can really only jump plus or minus 1 dimension with logic.  After that, it gets extremely confusing and counter-intuitive.  \n\nHowever I am always bolstered by this thought, to be honest.  Time seems really stressful for us because we obviously do not know the future.  There is someone that does know the future - for Him the past and future are as simple as looking left and right might be in a 3D reality - and he is telling us with absolute certainty that no matter how bad it gets, it's going to be alright in the end.  \n\n\nTough question to answer.  I feel like I probably didn't answer it thoroughly.  I wouldn't personally say that the universe is the body of God.  I am more comfortable saying that our body is the temple of God through which he communicates to us.  And our bodies were designed by Him, and contain many times many mathematical perfections.  \n\nBut are we Him?  \n\nI am dirty rags compared to Him.  \n",

            "body": "Well, I only heard it from an astral projector I met while doing the same thing. He said the Pleiadians were going to do it. I felt a bit of fear for an event like that, but ultimately nothing ended up happening. Cutting the power could be metaphorical for government or something. There was a bit of a language barrier, and the spirit that was telling us this had a very musical voice. I believe that maybe that person I met was already living mostly in the 4th dimension, he said he had traveled about as far as a light second while astral traveling in that single night, which is around the earth quite a few times at least. The supposed event was giving him the motivation needed to get all his spiritual affairs in order very shortly. Its possible that for him, those same events occurred in his astral 4d timeline, but maybe they don't have much to do with anyone else.\n\nI met Pleiadians again recently and asked them about disclosure and ascension. They assured me that both would happen, but I couldn't get any sort of estimate on how long it could be, I asked the question, a year, 5 years, 10, 20, 50, 100? He didn't answer. He showed me a cool device it was an electromagnet coil around the crown of the head above the ears that created specific frequencies. He said that it was designed to stimulate the sexual imaginative circuit in the brain. I tried it on and it does something similar to the kundalini frission you make in your head with directed mental probing around the boarders of your skull.\n\nThe Pleiadians said that they were a confederation with 300 billion people. They specifically did not have centralized authority, so anything 'the pleiadians' are doing is the doing of that specific group of Pleiadians, not them as a whole.\n\nI don't know a real reason to shut down the power grid, unless its simply to stop people from looking at the computer and to go outside lol. I can't really speculate too much about it. I just think its strange that people are still freaking out about north korea, when it seems to me like its simply scare tactics to keep people in fear of the future.",

            "body": "Quaternions define a directional axis and amount to rotate around it. \n\nImagine you have an umbrella and a big bucket of yellow paint and a fat paint brush. Open up the umberlla so the canopy isn't all bunched up. Now paint a big fat yellow stripe onto the canopy. Start at the center and pick an edge. Like you're cutting into a pie with a knife. Now pick up the umberlla and hold it up. Rotate it as you hold it. The yellow stripe rotates around the umberella neck. You can point the umberella in any direction, and rotate it. That what a quaternion represents in 3D space. \n\nQuaternion's are represented as a linear algebra equation and therefore solved using (linear algebra) matrix math. I wanted to point this out because quaternions are solved using algebra (and represented algebraically).  Because its just algebra, you can abstract a quaternion rotation into a higher dimension, by simply adding more parameters. So instead of an &lt;X,Y,Z&gt; umberlla axis, you can make a &lt;X,Y,Z,A,B,C,D&gt; to make a 7D axis to rotate and amount around. \n\nTo elaborate, Tesla's electromagnetism equations were said to be simplified. One of the things thought done was the equations were harcoded to a rigid 3D space. This was done by removing all quaternion (umberalla-style) rotations.  Instead 3D (pitch, roll, yaw) amounts were used to define all rotations. The downfall of this simplification, is that pitch yaw and roll is a change relative only; to your current orientation/perspective. You can also get problems known as gimbal lock, were calculating many net rotation changes over time, causes one to become stuck; and unable to rotate anymore.\n\nIn order to calculate Nth dimensional impacts of electromagnetism, one needs to leveraging angles that are not hardcoded to the &lt;X,Y,Z&gt; planes. You need something more abstract to define these higher-dimension rotations, like quaternions.\n\nI don't believe Eric Dollard was the person to simplify the Tesla equations to 3D space. I assume he is more an individual trying to back engineer, understand, and leverage the original Tesla equations.\n\n",

To be able to live here they need to lower their vibe to be in resonace ith this \"reality\". The artificial moon matrix is propably  a \"mechanical\" way to interfear with our natural source and frequency and propably  has more use, but this is not enough to keep the frequency of the earth low enough. This is why hybrids were created, the original enteties can't exist in ease here.\n\nWe all co-create this \"reality\" but most are not aware of this, this means most people create a lot by \"accident\" and are not aware of the concequences of their thoughts and actions. This is were the controll of humanity takes place on a different level. Everything is crated to keep us in fear, chaos and duality.\n\nI think \"they\" don't just \"feed\" on our negative energy, i think it provides \"them\" with the energy to make it more easy for \"them\" to exist in this \"reality\". \"They\" might be feeding on human flesh or blood, that would also explain a lot.\n\nThe one thing we can do is stop looking the other way and unite. We all know there is \"evil\" here, but we can't stop biggering over the smaller details, let allone that we come together and see it is all part of the same \"game\".\n\nWe need to realise we are all humans and we have a big commen problem that is made up out of many small problems like food and water supplies, shelter, government, education, pharma and so on. These are world wide problems and we need to distroy the root and not just the affects.\n\nIf we realise our \"reality\" is not made up out of solid stuff and it can be influenced in many ways we can make a start in solving this mess. Like i said, fear and Love govern this \"reality and honesty wil lead our way. We need to see this and use this, becouse it is now being used against us. If we start to live our life out of love and are honest to ourselves and others we will soon raise our vibe and thereby the vibe of our earth. We can't raise it on our own, but if we all start with ourselves and work from there into our environment Love and honesty will spread like an oil spot on water.\n\nIf we are able to heal ourselves we are also healing our earth and if we all raised our vibe high enough, \"they\" just can't exist here anymore, they won't get enough food/ energy to keep their vibe in resonace with our vibe.\n\nIn the end we are all one, including the ones now responsible for the \"evil\" in this \"reality\" so if we heal ourselves we are healing everything in this universe. We just need to become aware of who and what we really are and what we are actually capable of, if we all act out of love and honesty we will evolve as a species and not just as an individual.\n\nThe power for change lies within us all, somebody can make you aware of this power, but nobody can awake this power within for you. This is something we all need to do on our own, but it is one of the hardest thing to do here on earth, waking up out of the dream that is called our \"reality\". ",

The Sun is, in the 4th dimension and higher, a resonant object that traces the solar system with energy in a steady-state resonance which can be thought of in a phase portrait as a series of 3D loops. It creates the energy necessary for the Earth to design and animate lifeforms in the physical plane, whose inner energy is of course just solar energy converted into different forms to do work and generate fields of frequencies. The coalescence of these inner energetic processes culminates in our brain through sensory and motor complexes, which are controlled through the mechanisms of the mind, primarily the decision making directive created by your thalamus, sensory and association cortex, amygdala, prefrontal cingulate cortex, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and brainstem monoamine nuclei, etc. This pattern of decision making which seeks to balance emotional and physical needs is often thought of as the Ego, which is said to be the direct and proportional result of the configuration of our Sun. \n\nIn that way, we are reflections of the Sun because it is the progenitor of all Energy necessary for complex life on Earth. It's reasonable to conclude that our own fields would be altered by the fields of the Sun that we are in, as they will seek to reach an equilibrium relative to their energies through induction and transduction. This would need to be investigated to see if the electromagnetic fields of the Sun that reach Earth alter the emotional and physical states of the lifeforms and, if so, to what degree. Someone commented that sunspots have a strong positive regression revolutions so it may be possible.",

It's essentially a condensed prayer.\n\nIt's Christian symbology woven into a secular context - cannot be easily explained or recognized, so is resilient from other perspectives.\n\nProof: The entire QAnon larp-operation has been immersed in overt Christian context and phraseology from day 1. \n\nContext: 4chan and pol especially is well known as a place where religion is debated freely but profanely (loaded with the foulest language, porn-related themes, death and war porn, Hitler worship, very dark material, etc). There is a strong \"paleo-Christian\" element. But probably over 50% users are very overtly negative to Christianity. Paganism is a very big thing, in general, plus a lot of what you would expect: secular atheism.\n\nChristian Spirituality: It appears that the authors of the information take a spiritual dimension to this conflict seriously - which might explain the incessant request for prayer support. Perhaps given the very dark nature of the underlying supposition that there is a satanic elite involved in the worst possible crimes that a still barely majority Christian electorate could imagine. It seems they anticipate the need for some \"white magic\" (prayer) to counterbalance whatever \"black magic\" has enabled such an elite conspiracy to dominate the planet thus far.\n\nConclusion: By overtly using Christian motifs in this larp-operation, the authors are telegraphing something to the world beyond 4Chan, which effectively tells the rest of their audience what side they believe they are fighting for.",

Lots of them you have to buy bitcoin before you can get in on another.  Your idea makes sense.....The coin I'd like to get my hands on is Ripple and this AGI.  But Ripple can't get without other currency like bitcoin yet.   Thing with ripple is the banks are buying it to do exchanges, so maybe that is the agency infiltration.  Just typing out loud now.  \n\nFor sure the US is synonomys with out of control black projects.  Look at SE Asia and Air America.  Not the movie the book.  They had no idea how many airlines they owned and completely lost control of opertaions that were occuring.  \n\nKind of like men who stare at goats, the book again not the movie.  Wild shit going on in there and if you read the book that program never stopped and I've noticed online the last few months they have a youtube channel now.  First Earth Battalion.  They wanted to combat war with psyops and dancing and frequency and mkultra stuff.  The whole power of focus and law of attraction principal had the government obsessed.  So with that line of thinking, if bitcoin is legit and people are believing, the law of attraction at work is not in the evil peoples favor.\n\nBut then you hear the crazy ass podcast on youtube that bitcoin is AI from another dimension and ushering in the beast.  It is coming to take over the world.  Good thing I like buddhism and believe what you think is what is.  \n\nIt could be Alien, what better way to understand understand humans by the internet and instead of learning all the languages, just use math.

            "body": "Here's how I understand it:  \nTime doesn't separate things and events. All events and all things are inherently connected over time. It's just that from a solely 3 dimensional, physical perspective it appears that every thing and every event is isolated from one another. Consciousness/the conscious field (aka: the inherent, multidimensional connection between all things, which therefore gives rise to perspective relativity) exists on all dimensions, connecting all things and events to each other. Connecting every thing and event in this universe from \"beginning\" to \"end\", and every other thing and event from every other possible universe from beginning to end etc etc etc, and as it funnels down through dimensions and universes to our universe (aka: our relative conscious interference pattern), it forms nodes at all \"things\". And where it funnels down into life - and specifically human life - since the brain is wired in such the way that it is, it gives rise to self awareness at each of those respective nodes. Human consciousness is just a node in the universal conscious interference pattern. A collapsing of the absolute wave function. Wherein \"the absolute\" wave function is the ground state of *everything*: Brahman/the absolute/God.  \nWe can immediately see each surrounding node (each other person, animal, plant, object etc: every physical \"thing\") due to them all existing, respectively, at the same physical dimension that we do, but it takes a change in perspective to view the nodes in non-physical events (Like how nodes on a vibrating string can \"see\" those immediately next to it, but it would require a change in perspective - like seeing the string from above - to see the whole string and how all its individual nodes are just parts of the whole). It also takes a change in perspective to view the connection between respective \"isolated\" nodes in our universe, and we can do this from a 3d perspective by viewing things *over the course of time*, or alternatively by utilising transcendental states: states in which we can project our relative human consciousness back up the funnel and view things from higher dimensions. We can directly access these states through meditation, dreaming, psychedelics, or astral projection. But aspects of these higher dimensional perspectives naturally \"leak\" into our lives on occasion anyway, either through dreams, synchronicities, or intuition etc. To an individual uneducated/inexperienced in the topic these things can be explained away by \"coincidence\", but that's just an interpretation/misrepresentation based on ignorance to the bigger picture. Those educated and experienced (yogis, gurus, quantum physicists, astral projectors, psychonauts) may recognise these as a artifacts of higher dimensional connection, and if they act accordingly they may utilise these artifacts to the advantage of either themselves or others.",

I understood how they got there, but I disagreed the first time I heard it and I disagree now that it's racist. I think the entire position is based in feelings and not reality.  \n\n&gt;People from \"shithole\" countries have plenty of value to bring to the table. Just as much as any person, that's what makes America great. \n\n\"The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.\n\nThe health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. Refer to Technical notes for more details.\n\nThe HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc. The HDRO offers the other composite indices as broader proxy on some of the key issues of human development, inequality, gender disparity and poverty.\n\nA fuller picture of a country's level of human development requires analysis of other indicators and information presented in the statistical annex of the report.\" \n\nIn this index Haiti (one of the countries specifically called out as a shithole) ranks 163rd. Norway (also specifically mentioned as a counter point to the \"shithole\" countries ranks 1st.\n\n&gt;Immigration from any country brings other culture and people who are more patriotic than most lifetime citizens.\n\nCitation needed.

You have a good 24-72 hour surge in literal chaos -- looting, assault, killing, arson.  For the really big riots (like the Rodney King LA riots), it kind of takes on its own dimension -- the cops barely try to contain it, and people intensify their chaos knowing the cops can't or won't stop it.\n\nI could definitely see something like a major event being predicted and demand for resources outstripping available supply and this devolving into riots and looting, and depending on the destructive potential of the predicted event, the government failing to gain any kind of civil order.  Either because they can't maintain discipline (troops/cop desert their jobs) or they're just reserving their own troops/supplies for post-event containment.\n\n&gt; You don't know that there's NOT another EMP blast coming, because no one would tell you if there was.

Porn has already convinced them that hostility and sexuality are near-interchangeable, so it may come naturally to them to transmute this angry resentment into a repressed sexual desire.\n\nIMO this is big speculation, but on the whole I feel it's not a conspiracy, moreso a handful of economic and cultural trends converging in an especially dark place.  I think the ramp-up of the \"extremeness\" of porn since the 90's is largely a result of a *general* desensitization and overstimulation because of our hyper-connected, media-saturated lifestyle. It got harder to make people excited or impressed by stuff and so porn go increasingly extreme just for the sake of novelty. \n\n",

Before the trip I set the intention for an healing experience (I suffered from aches from walking with crutches for a year and a half, mainly back, shoulder and hip) I ate 5 grams of mushrooms (better safe than sorry) and on the peak I started smoking DMT. \n\nBefore I new it, I was immersed in a landscape of swirling fractals,  trough the swirling, mostly green fractals I saw some entities popping up and disappearing. As they stayed longer in the fractal whirlwind I could see they where jesters, observing me and playfully popping in and out of my fractal world. \nThen a portal opened and I got sucked into a void and out of my body. At first it was completely dark around me, then more and more pulsating energy starting to emerge around me, small lights where floating around that looked like fireflies in slow motion nearby and stars further away, the lights where white, cyan and indigo and all around me. \n\nSuddenly out of the lights I saw entities manifesting, as they became brighter and brighter I could see five machine elves floating (staying at the same location) around me, each with a different look and a different character. At this point I still had no body and I had a 360 degree view around me. Suddenly they started sending waves of love / energy to me from all five directions, where the five streams collided my body was reconstructed but this time a much lighter body, I was made of light and able to move around. As I was moving around I noticed the lights had disapeared and I was now in what seemed like a dense tropical forest, but there was no up and down, no ground or sky, it was more immersive and very beautiful, a bit Avatar like. Suddenly the oldest and wisest looking machine elf approached me and stopped at arm length distance, he stared at me for what felt like a couple of minutes https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3b6ea7c94d1f907a4ac091e87965b502-c (this is somewhat of a resemblance of what he looked like) It felt like being read. I knew, he knew everything about me, there was no communication with him. \n\nAs he backed off to his place in the circle, the smallest and most playful machine elf approached me and hugged me, I was shocked that I could feel a real physical hug from this creature (I still was aware that I had smoked DMT). As he hugged me, I asked, why do I still suffer so much pain? I thought I could go on with life right now... He said: \"because you're going to learn something because of it.\" Then everything started fading away, I wanted to hug the little guy a bit longer, but it was time for me to go back to my own dimension. \n\nNow almost a year later I healed my body with Qi gong, and practice it everyday, it also learned me how to cope with being an empath and use it as a gift, instead as the curse that it used to be (ok, and can still be from time to time).

            "body": "&gt;\"Cultural Marxism\" is not a real sociological phenomena.\n\nNo, I disagree.  It's a real concept.  However, while I have antipathy toward Marxism because I'm a libertarian minarchist which supports a free market, I will at least grant you that it's not *true Marxism*.  Even so, it is most certainly a thing that does exist and must be discussed in these terms because it is a function of how the system operates.\n\nThe reason the term is offensive to you is because you rightly understand this concept as something of a *bastardization* of true Marxist ideas.  Real Marxism is, for you, the economic philosophy based on the idea that the workers are exploited by a bourgoise capitalist class and it proposes that the means of production need to be owned by society to fix this.  (Hell, Libertarians are mostly with you on this one.... except we call it \"crony capitalism\" and don't throw the \"free market\" baby out with the \"corrupt crony bastard\" bathwater.... but I digress)\n\n\"Cultural Marxism,\" however, is a perverse bastardization of the general concept inherent in Marxism.  The idea of \"class struggle\" was translated into an entirely different social dimension by the intelligentsia that created it.  This can be directly traced to the consequences of \"ideological subversion\" by the Soviet Union against the NATO bloc during the latter half of the 20th Century.  Instead of focusing on economic oppression, it is instead based on cultural and identity properties which are divided into a \"historic oppressor\" class that bears eternal Kafkaesque guilt and a \"historic victim\" class that must now receive reparations.  This is in fact an operative form of Marxism even if it's perverted from its original designs.\n\nThe result of this ideological subversion has been the insane identity politics and radical progressivism which has arisen in recent decades.  It is the application of a clever subversion which was meant to undermine the integrity of the social institutions of the West to make them ripe for conquest by the Soviet Bloc because it effectively poisons any minds that embrace it.  The idea of the Soviet intelligentsia was that that true Marxism would win out because it had \"strong workers\" and did not tolerate this insanity.\n\nIn a nutshell, \"cultural Marxism\" is basically a \"strawman\" version of Leninist-Stalinist Communism with the intent of making idiots in the West buy into it so that the West could eventually be overthrown.  The project outlived the Soviet Union, however, and it was probably picked up by some of the crony capitalists like the Clintons and the Bushes for their own power agenda...",

I'll try and include as much source and reference material as I can, but if anyone else has more to add then I only encourage it.  \n\n**Holographic Universe:**  \nMainly referencing the fractal-holographic theory of Nassim Haramein, the fractal-holographic theory essentially suggests that the universe is, at a fundamental level, made up of 'bits' of information, and that the information of the entire system is fractally encoded at every point through harmonic layering/nesting. Much like how DNA, a chemical compound within every single cell of a body, contains the information to recreate the entire human. A great metaphor to describe this is the Sutra of \"Indra's Net\":  \n*\"Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each \"eye\" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering \"like\" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.\"*  \nIn this metaphor the jewels represent protons. Nassim Haramein tackled what's known as the 'vacuum catastrophe' (a mathematical problem that arises when you add up the number of vacuum fluctuations in a unit of space, as the mass that is calculated comes out absurdly larger than that which is actually measured in that same unit of space - for example: when adding up the vacuum fluctuations in a cubic centimetre of space you yield 10^93 grams, whereas if you were to take all the measurable mass of the observable universe and squish it into that same space you'd get 10^55 grams) by figuring out how we can derive the mass of matter from the fundamental planck unit. When you divide the volume of a proton by the volume of a planck sphere unit (a spherical unit of energy of planck length diameter, proposed by Nassim to be one of these fundamental 'bits' of information that make up the universe) and then multiply by the planck mass, you come out with the mass of the observable universe: 10^55 grams.  \nThis shows that the exact amount of vacuum fluctuations that fit into a proton - when the planck spheres are stacked in a 3 dimensional [\"flower of life\" formation](https://gfycat.com/TenderLateEmperorshrimp) (as opposed to being stacked in a [cubic](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-faH_PCj4KYY/UDAvatnFtHI/AAAAAAAABDc/-xZuTez_JKk/s1600/SimpleCubicPack.jpg) formation) - equals the measurable mass of the observable universe.  \nBut obviously that's not what we see when we measure the mass of a proton. Due to the size:mass ratio of the proton it fulfills the Schwartzschild condition for a black hole. Once we consider the proton to act as a black hole we can borrow a mathematical concept from string theory - the holographic principle - which states that the surface information of a black hole can encode the volume information. When you apply this, and divide the surface planck spheres by the volume planck spheres and then multiply by the planck mass, you arrive at the measured proton's rest mass of ~10^-24 grams.  \nEach proton in the universe holographically contains the information of every other proton in the universe. And every surface planck sphere of every acts as a wormhole terminations which connect all protons via a superfluid/superconducting aether, allowing instantaneous information transfer between all protons via an instantaneous information feedback-loop network.  \n*It's this universal instantaneous feedback-loop network that gives rise to consciousness at a universal scale.* And from there, due to the fractal self-configuring/self-evolving nature of the system, consciousness evolves to form higher and higher orders of self-complexity within the system.  \nFor more information visit the /r/holofractal subreddit, from which I've taken taken this info and condensed it for this post (big shoutout and serious thanks to the admin of that sub /u/d8_thc for being such a good communicator of this information), and have a read of the stickied posts and links in the sidebar.  \nAlso here's Nassim Haramein's \"The Connected Universe\" [2015 lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbE5bVl8r2g) on the subject.  \nHere's his \"The Connected Universe\" [2017 documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uScP9ntLLeQ) (narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart).  \nAnd here's one of his papers on the subject: [\"The Unified Spacememory Network: From Cosmogenesis to Consciousness\"](https://holofractal.org/hf/spacememory.pdf)  \n",

That isn\u2019t to say they are boring.\n\nWhat is worth noting is that it is an old phenomenon that got big in the 1980\u2019s.  The difference in the complex ones of \u201creal\u201d or \u201cfake\u201d is how much planning went into man made ones.  Due to the nature of crops, the really intricate one may have been created over weeks of surveying and marking but only \u201cpressed down\u201d in one night.  Marker flags and such wouldn\u2019t be seen while it was being planned.\n\nHowever, the original and real ones (even if man made) could tie into to ancient cultural memories and some other dimensional something.  Look at all the henges around the world and stone circles.  Cultural memory and legends run looooong.  The area in Britain here they were primarily found was tied to very ancient cultures making circles in he ground.  Maybe the early \u201choaxes\u201d were carrying on a folk religion that was a shadow of the ancient one.  Maybe it is tied to forces we don\u2019t understand that the ancient Neolithic cultures were trying to represent or understand with their own circles?  \n\nI think this is far more interesting than \u201cayyyliens\u201d did it.",

My point is that there are so many combinations measurements available so why this particular combination is selected? The division by two after taking their ratio is completely arbitrary and is just to force pi.\n\n2) The ratio between radius of earth and height of great pyramid is much closer to 434000 than 432000, circumference of earth and base perimeter of great pyramid is around 435000 not 432000.\n\n\n&gt;3,023.16 feet x 432,000 = 1,306,005,120 feet = 24,734.94 miles\n\n\nAlso Your math is off by a whole order of magnitude, so you clearly have not checked it. \n\n\n3) Let me explain. Let, height of great pyramid be (h) , base perimeter of great pyramid be p, radius of earth be r, circumference of earth be c.\n\n\nFrom your first statement p/h  \u2248 2*pi, by definition the ratio between the circumference of any circle and its radius  2*pi. So we can take any circular spherical or cylindrical object and we can say that the ratio of its circumference is the same as p/h. We can do this with any object, all we have to do is pick a magic number as a scaling factor and look for any object which has a similar size as the scaled down or up dimension. \n\n\nFor example a my dick is approximately cylindrical and has a radius of 1.3 inches the circumference of its cross section is \u2248 8.168 inches.\n\n\nWe all know 432 is special so 4320 is also special.\n\n\n**Height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet\n\n\n481.3949 feet \u00f7 4320 = 0.111434005 ft = 1.33720806 inches.\n\n\n1.33720806 inches = Radius of my dick (with an error of 2%)\n\n\nBase perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet\n\n\n3,023.16 feet \u00f7 4320 = 0.699805556 ft = 8.397666672 inches.\n\n\n8.397666672 inches = the circumference of my dick (with an error of 2%)**\n\nSpooooooky\n\nEither ancient Egyptians scaled the pyramids with respect to my dick (in a ratio of 1:4320) or this type of argument is bullshit. You pick.\n\n4) Where is it stated in the pyramid that the speed of light is 432 squared in miles per second? Miles and seconds were units invented 1000s years after the Ancient Egyptians.\n\n&gt; you realize we didn't even get close to an accurate estimate of the speed of light until thousands of years later right?\n\nIf it is not explicitly written down or used in some sort of measurement that the speed of light is so and so then we cannot assume that they knew it.All this arithmetic voodoo is just working backwards from what we already know. \n\n\n&gt; the speed of light is actually coded into the pyramid in other ways, including one that matches it in the metric system, down to several decimal places\n\nAgain metric system is 1000s of years younger than the pyramids. So you are saying that not only did the Egyptians know the speed of light but they also knew what units we would use in the future.\nWhich is more plausible Ancient Egyptians had advanced scientific knowledge and ability to *predict the future* or all these \"codes\" that you seem to find in the pyramids are a product of your own confirmation bias?? \n\n5) The fact that the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon and is 400 times as far is amazing but it is still a coincidence.\n \n&gt; two largest objects in the sky, using only 2 numbers, 2 operations, and scaling by 10s is amazing\n\n\nBut it is not just two operations, you arbitrarily round up the moon's size and round down the sun's size. Anything can seem related if you apply arbitrary set of rules.\n\nPersonal attacks are unnecessary and exposes your own childishness.",

In other words, one can leave the trials and tribulations of this level of planet Earth, evolving significantly *away* from what\u2019s going on in this third dimension such that you are no longer existing in that dimension, but *still* be very much on Earth itself - just a different dimension of it that vibrates at a different frequency and does not overlap with *this* one so the beings on either dimension(s) aren\u2019t generally aware of one another.\n\nMany different radio stations, all existing in the here and now, all with a different, unique, individual signature, none of them (generally) overlapping one another, yet all existing within one radio.\n\nGonna look at the \u201cI, Pet Goat II\u201d video again.

Glad I looked at it again.  Great observation w/regard to the ice cavern and the christ consciousness\u2019 focus away from all of it.\n\nNamaste,",

            "body": "This video goes into more detail and correlates all the previous info. Also this correlation of area and volume to space and time is explained by Hugh Harleston Jr to Graham Hancock. The teotihuacan code found that the geometry encodes a tetrahedron within a sphere and also the planetary distances at a smaller ratio, this same knowledge can be found in the Nineveh constant, going full circle back to the Sumerian who we get our measurements of time from.\n\nHypercubing The Hypersphere DNA Music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj7pilxUHWw\n\n(UPDATE: Hypercubing The Hypersphere Extras (DNA Music Ancient Unified Field Preview)\nhttps://youtu.be/10fa0I7rFpA)\n\nCarl Munck discovered that the ancient prime meridian is Giza in Egypt, the location of the Great Pyramids being at the exact center of all land masses on the planet, the Giza complex being equidistant to the pole to the center of the earth and aligning on the 19.45 degree latitude; these being important sites for a specific kind of energy flow, many ancient sites being built along this energy grid in every continent. The measurements that Hughes Hollister Jr. found at Teotihuacan show that measurements unify time and space in geometry and form. This can be seen in the egyptian or royal cubit, the vestiges of an ancient system that took into account a musical harmony of repeating divine proportions related to pi, and specifically 22/7 which is the measure of thoth/hermes in egyptian pantheon of gods. The macrocosm/microcosm belief of the ancients shared through almost every culture and still today part of our present system, in British measurements and our time measurements that are Sumerian(Sumerian were allegedly the first to divide the circle into 360 degrees). Where Munck left off Bruce Cathie discovered correlations to the speed of light and area of land mass having direct harmonic proportions to an electromagnetic grid which owes its very geometry and size to sacred divisions inherent in light. The Sumerian time scale reflecting this platonic solid Pythagorean music of the spheres, as above so below, hermetic ordering of the cosmos and space-time; the actual geometry to Einstein's unified field as seen throughout nature and even the law of octaves in the periodic table. Energy/matter/time/space unified in repeating numbers from the average pace of man to the egyptian royal cubit measured from tip of the finger to the elbow. The precession of the equinoxes showing a repeating cycle dictated by the stars, themselves being an expression of the proportional constants inherent in the platonic solids which describe forms of consciousness as well as the elements and sacred divisions. This universal pattern manifesting on the galactic scale as precession can also be seen at the solar system level; the planets creating spirograph figures directly related to sacred proportions and music of the spheres; all of this being mathematically deduced toward to geometric figures, the circle  and sphere in squaring the circle. And still further, the ancients seemed to have knowledge of hyperforms, higher dimensional blue-prints that manifest into the laws/figures/forms of our  dimension; these are the tetractys,tesseract, and hypercube. The hypersphere or nested tori being seen in concepts of metaphysics such as the merkaba, merkava, or chariot related to the magnetic field of the human body. To get a better understanding we must not only square the circle or cube the sphere but hypercube the hypersphere. \n\nThe measurements given to us by the gods seem to be embedded in allegory themselves, each culture descending from the megalithic temple builders having some vestige of their ancient teachings still existing in modern times yet always following the same sacred proportions and building their temples as a reflection of man and the cosmos as a midway point between either.\n\nThe tree of life being the strongest argument towards a hyperdimensional unified form that encoded time/space/consciousness/geometry/architecture into one system that explained the universe.\n\nPlatonic Solids:\nTetrahedron 4 faces, 4 points, 6 edges. 720 degrees.\nOctahedron 8 faces, 6 points, 12 edges. 1440 degrees.\nCube 6 faces, 8 points, 12 edges. 2160 degrees.\nIcosahedron 20 faces, 12 points, 30 edges. 3600 degrees.\nDodecahedron 12 faces, 20 points, 30 edges. 6480 degrees.\n\nSumerian Time Measurements:\nOne solar day = 24 hours\n24 hours x 60 min = 1,400 minutes\n1,400 min x 60 sec = 86,400 seconds\n720 min x 60 sec = 43,200 seconds\n\nPrecession of The Equinoxes:\nOn Great Cycle (Platonic Year) = 25,920 years\n-360 days: 6480 hours: 518400 minutes\n\nThree Platonic months (one platonic season) = 6,480 years\n90 days: 2160 hours: 129,600 minutes\n\nSaros Cycle (60x60)= 3,600 years\n50 days: 1200 hours: 72,000 minutes\n\nThree Decans (30 degrees of Ecliptic, One platonic month) = 2,160 years\n30 Days: 720 Hours: 43,200 minutes\n\nTwo Decans (20 degrees of Ecliptic) = 1,440 years\n20 Days: 480 Hours: 28, 800 minutes\n\nOne Decan (10 degrees of Ecliptic) = 720 years\n10 Days: 240 Hours: 1,440 minutes\n\nSacred Numbers Embedded In Time\n25,920 seconds   = 432 minutes\n432 minutes      = 7.2 hours\n12,960 seconds   = 216 minutes\n6,480 seconds    = 108 minutes\n25,920 hours     = 1080 days\n25,920 days      = 72 years of 360 days\n\nGreat Pyramid in Royal Cubits:\nBase      = 440 cubits\nHeight    = 280 cubits\nSum       = 720 cubits\nSlope     = 356 cubits\nEdge      = 418 cubits\n\nNumber of outer layer casing stones:\n144,000\n\nExcerpt from 'http://www.ancient-world-mysteries.com/great-pyramid-base-length.html'\n\n'the base-line of the structure should be exactly 1 / 14400 of the elliptical arc length distance between the centre of the pyramid and the equator of the earth'\n\n'Based upon the above evaluation, including that given previously concerning the latitudinal placement of the Great Pyramid, it would appear that there is clear evidence to suggest that two primary principles were employed, to fix both the global (latitude) position of the structure, and also its relative size to the earth. And that they were practically realised in sequence:\n\n1) Firstly, the builders determined the precise latitudinal placement upon the earth, as gave a ratio between the small circle circumference of the planet and the elliptical arc up from the equator of 10.14561622 (x 10 the value of change for the earth tropical year).\n\n2) When the latitude had been fixed, the builders then took the full measure of the elliptical arc length from the established centre of the structure to the equator, and divided it by 14400. In doing so they thus further determined what would be the primary physical base of the pyramid.'\n\nEgyptian Cubit excerpts from 'http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rgrosser/amarna/neywetaten/measures.htm'",

I give it 40% of all the leaked consciousness' to accept their mercy and the other 60% to want to join their demons down in another thrown out dimension. This happens every cycle of the universe, and everyone is locked in the same timeline. Make your choice. ",

For those who have not heard of the Monroe Institute, they were an organization dedicated to exploring astral projection and mapping put the world one can access through this practice. They developed a method for synchronizing brain activity between the two hemispheres in order to help induce this altered state of consciousness that they named Hemisync, which can be bought from them or \"downloaded\". From what I can tell in their effort to essentially weaponize astral projection the CIA ended up having a reverse Event Horizon experience where they discovered the astral plane in its entirety and discovered many things in the process. The document goes over such subjects as the toroidal nature of our universe and how it explains cosmic inflation, how human consciousness functions, how astral projection actually works, and details on the astral plane itself all from a scientific perspective. The big thing to stand out though is something that they call the Absolute, which they say they found at the end of all the astral dimensions. It is described as having no beginning, no end, no locality, and as infinite conscious energy at rest. It permeates every instance of time and space, existing everywhere and everywhen at once.

Now Germany, China, many others are freaking the fuck out because the U.S. is legit attracting Corporations to come back\n\nSwamp = Globalism, Rothschilds/Soros, Central Banking/Fiat System via IMF/CFR/Tri-Lateral Commission, MIC/FBI/CIA, Cultural Marxism/Kalgeri Plan/Forced Diversity, the new German Speech Censorship rules, and it continues from there.\n\nIf Trumpo was el swampo, he would of never rejected TPP + Paris Agreement.\n\nAlso the tax cut to corporations has a bunch of corporations making plans to bring their businesses back here and China, Germany, Other nations are freaking the fuck out right now:\n\nhttps://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/germans-fear-huge-loss-of-jobs-from-us-tax-reform-865577?bfa9\n\n&gt;\u201cThe tax competition will have a new dimension,\u201d said Christoph Spengel, chairman of the corporate tax department at the University of Mannheim. Mr. Spengel, who is also a research associate at the Center for European Economic Research, and a group of tax experts at the university have done a detailed comparison of the two countries\u2019 tax systems and published a report under the heading, \u201cGermany loses out in US tax reform.\u201d\n\n&gt;Clemens Fuest, who heads the Ifo economic think tank, also said he believed German business would suffer. \u201cInvestments and jobs will migrate to the US,\u201d he said.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-develops-plan-to-counter-trump-tax-overhaul-1513012363\n\n&gt;BEIJING\u2014As the U.S. prepares to take China to task over trade imbalances, economic mandarins in Beijing are focusing on a potentially more immediate threat from Washington\u2014Donald Trump\u2019s tax overhaul.\n\n&gt;In the Beijing leadership compound of Zhongnanhai, officials are putting in place a contingency plan to combat consequences for China of U.S. tax changes as well as expected interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, according to people with knowledge of the matter. What they fear is a double whammy sapping money out of...\n\nIf Trump was swamp, he would toe the line with Globalists and continue to allow the U.S. economy to get fucked over as it was under Obama and prior Presidents.\n\n&gt;so how do we get people to keep trump from selling us out even more then he has\n\nHE's not perfect, and I dont want anything to do with Israel or the Banksters. But, imagine you become Prez and realize the Jews literally run and own the Media, the Banks, the IMF, are the Top Elites (Rothschilds/Soros/Et el), you sort of at the very least have to play nice and pretend.\n\nIn terms of banking, cryptocurrencies are fucking up their game right now and they are pissed about it. Sure they can create laws or force a 1 world crypto mandated, but the cats out the bag and money is now globally decentralized and growing in epic proportions.\n\nThe Israel problem, that's probably the biggest problem there is and its not so easy to just tell them fuck off and think everything will be gravy, they'll just pull another 9/11 like they did the first time w/ the Saudis.\n\nPulling away from the joos will take a very long time, being very quiet about it, and being as keen as possible and even that doesnt guarantee anything.\n\nLook at how the Jewish Banksters are fucking up Europe right now with Islamic immigration by the 10's of Millions. Why?\n\nAll because the EU population was having less kids which = less debt/wage slave cogs, which means less $ for the banksters, taxes, etc. So they decided they will replace the natives with 3rd worlders, and yet 90% are on gov housing and gov handouts.\n\nIts a massive mess, I think Korea is legit. I think Venezuela Collapsed because the CIA made that happen after they Cancered Chavez, but I think Iran is another MIC Psyop.\n\nEnd of the day, shit is confusing. Maybe Trump is letting the Jews have Iran in exchanging for something?",

In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each \"eye\" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering \"like\" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.[5]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net\n\nAlso, I highly recommend people read Herman Hesse's Siddhartha, a book that \"deals with the spiritual journey of self-discovery of a man named Siddhartha during the time of the Gautama Buddha.\"",

As far as I understood the theory correctly everything is about the experience, the experience of all possibilities of the universe.\n\nDuring third dimensions you are supposed to learn conscious behaviour, life does not just happen, you create your own reality. The realities of other beings might be disharmonic and chaotic, as long as you consciously choose to live a harmonic life you will most probably have one. You are supposed to not feel like there is nothing you can do and you are completely dependant upon external factors, you should realise that you make an impact. You impact everyone you meet and through your actions you influence what reality you live in. \n\nIn fourth dimension you learn love in all possible facets. This is either love of self or love of others depending wether you qualified for positive or negative polarity. In positive the social memory complex will be formed here. Living as a social memory complex is described as everyone knows everyone and feels deeply attached to everyone like family. \n\nThe fifth dimension is the one of wisdom. You just learn about the ways of the universe either alone (negative) or as a social memory complex(positive).\n\nIn sixth dimension and onwards there is no polarity anymore.\nAs far as I understood seventh dimension is the top tier and then you rejoin the \"light\". \nBut then nothing is finite and the \"end\" is most probably just a new beginning in the never ending cycle of the universe.",

The more you fit inside you the more power you get from Lucifer and the more deceived and lost you will become.  They will appear to be anything you want.  Aliens, dead relative, yourself form another dimension, literally anything.\n\nEventually these spiritual entities will begin to torment you because that's all they really want.

They know he is their Lord and his very name has power over them.\n\nMar 5:2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, \nMar 5:3  Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: \nMar 5:4  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. \nMar 5:5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. \nMar 5:6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, \nMar 5:7  And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. \nMar 5:8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. \nMar 5:9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. \nMar 5:10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. \nMar 5:11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. \nMar 5:12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. \nMar 5:13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. \nMar 5:14  And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. \nMar 5:15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. \n\nYou can be saved by the grace of God through the sacrifice made by him as he manifested in the flesh as Jesus Christ.  Simply repent and believe his Gospel which is:\n\n1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; \n1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. \n1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; \n1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: \n\nIt's really that simple.  He did everything for you.  There is nothing you can do yourself.  Just tell him the best way you know how that you repent of your unbelief and sinful nature and believe his gospel and he will quicken your spirit and make you alive.",

            "body": "it is very complicated but I'll try to explain\n\nI believe within the next 100, 150 years max this world is going to be drastically different. We are entering a new astrological age in Aquarius and exiting Pisces. We are living in the \"end of times\" Jesus forewarned about. Now, whether you want to take this literal or understand it's meaning on a metaphysical level (the latter of which I choose to do and think others should as well) is your choice, but what can't be argued is going along with the Zodiac timeline that dates back 1000's of years we are entering the age of Aquarius.\n\nOkay, so there's been a battle of good and evil since the beginning of our consciousness as we know it. People like to refer to the evil group as \"Illuminati\" but really it's just practitioners of a mystery religion that dates back to Babylon (see Bill Cooper's Mystery Babylon). Why people would practice this stuff is it gives you \"power\" in this dimension . Money, fame, etc.\n\nOkay, so putting those two together, leaving the age of Pisces and the mystery religion/occult, the occult is very aware we are leaving this astrological age. I can also tell you (from first hand experience) that these people hate Jesus because they know his teaching is able to bring people to the light (this is a whole other discussion, anyways continuing)\n\nSo, as we are leaving this astrological age the theory is that these high ranking occultists are looking for a way to immortality (a modern day tower of babel). Basically, the plan is to use technology to get there. Technology is advancing at a rate that humans are not able to comprehend, and as Carl Jung said, we have probably opened up Pandora's box here. Eventually this technology is going to be able to surpass human capabilities. \n\nSo long story short because this is all very confusing when first hearing it (and confusing to me even talking about it but this occult stuff is weird in itself) as this age ends and technology is advancing this world is going to never be the same within 100-150 years, and the occult agenda has to do with going into space and becoming star children. I do believe, whether occult or not, we're gonna be in space a lot as a species during this new astrological age. The last 30 minutes of the 2001 movie is basically a allegory for an occult ritual in which the end result is becoming a star child by the end (again this is very complicated).\n\nBasically they think shit's about to get real on Earth (they are right it's just a matter of when) and are planning for a way to join the cosmos. I'll keep it short with this one, but going along with the theory I believe our consciousness as we know it could be coming to an end in the next 100-150 years, and with the rapid advancement of technology there is a theory that the occult believes a digital matrix in which we can \"live forever\" is going to be created when the time comes (see Don Hertzfeldt's World of Tomorrow for a good visual representation of this)",

I'm not into number stuff - but I've always thought spirits we see aren't really themselves, but energy trapped in a decaying loop and when we mess with the enviornment (such as tearing down walls in a house, redirecting a large body of water or massive landscape reconstruction) - we, much like those that move the rivers, cause the \"flow of energy\" to be interrupted. This causes historical events like a soldier walking through a field and being shot - to loop over and over again in a dimension we can see/interact with.\n\nI don't think ghosts are sentient. I think they are impressions in time and space of an event with enough \"energy\" that the impressions exist well long after those who experienced it first hand are gone. ***With that said*** ... I am wondering if the events on 9/11 were so impactful to our world on both levels of dimensions we do interact with and those we do not - that things like seeing 9:11 everywhere are echos and symptoms of that catastrophic event. Especially since the buildings no longer exist and the area around the event has been highly renovated and reconstructed. \n\n",

I have been training myself in that dimension to develop my skills as much as possible. Telekinesis is very real in the astral and can be a very powerful ability for self defense. If people are going to refuse to be abused by them in the Astral development of strong telekinesis must be developed on the Astral level.

The larger and more all-encompassing the power structure, the more difficult it is for popular political movements to fight it and defend the interests of the people.  \n\nOnce we are talking about transnational power structures like massive global banks, colluding and unaccountable intelligence agencies, multinational energy corporations, etc, there is literally no democratic institution that can stick up for the common man with a comparable level of power -- even the countries that are democracies are limited by national boundaries.  Thats why you see the world governments starting to lose legitimacy -- they literally have no power or dwindling power compared to the emerging neoliberal global order of dominant finance institutions and conglomerates.  \n\nHere's an example of what I mean: in the US we had a labor movement in the 20th century to fight for better working conditions and higher wages.  And look, all the industry left the US and went elsewhere.  And we are powerless to stop that.  Now if the Chinese do that, the same thing will happen to them.  Keep in mind how hard it was to organize a labor movement in the US.  How could we organize a global labor movement?  It would be practically impossible.  So you see as power accumulates in the hands of a few, and while its dominance grows to encompass the whole world, it becomes more and more difficult to fight.\n\nThats why its a bad thing that everyone along every dimension of the political spectrum should oppose.",

            "body": "First, I want to apologize in advance for the length of my reply.  \n\nI am only detouring from the initial intent of this post due to the critical nature of your accusations against the Christian community, even though you qualified it by stating \"hardcore fundamentalist Christian communities\".  There is a HUGE difference!\n\nAfter this lengthy response, I would like to stay on topic regarding my main premise. \n\n**Why did the authorities keep quite?**\n\nAs I suspected, the articles you referenced are attributing beliefs and practices - in a blanket fashion - to fundamentalist (and at times evangelical) Christianity as norms within the church.  They are not!\n\n**From Seattle Times**\n&gt;The culture of courting that Easter and Brightbill described is one limited mostly to fundamentalist religious communities, including certain Christian groups and those of other religions, such as some Orthodox Jewish or Mormon communities.\n\n&gt;For most evangelical Christians, relationships between older men and teenage girls are viewed as wholly inappropriate.\n\nAs the article clearly states, evangelical Christians do not condone this type of behavior.  Neither do I.  There is a huge difference between a young man (20) marrying an even younger girl (Duck Dynasty's Phil Robertson example) than what is otherwise proposed as the norm, even as the writer speaks in overly broad generalities within the article.\n\n**The post from sheworships.com** is an odd insertion into this list, as the blogger references a separate post whose link didn't work for me.  From what I gather, it was from one man writing a list of 10 attributes to be wary of, one of which was that it's hard to \"lead\" an older woman.  The author was only four years older than her husband.  Not even in the same dimension.\n\n***From The Dailey Banter***\nI could immediately tell there was no bias in this article just from the title: **Conservative Christianity Has Enabled Pedophiles for Untold Decades**\n\nAnd I quote:\n&gt;Despite my own hostility towards religion as a **militant atheist**, I feel it's important to make this distinction because all too often, people equate the religion with the crime which is not really fair. On the other hand, it's perfectly reasonable, responsible even, to point out that it's the \"conservative\" part of \"conservative Christianity\" that lends itself most to creating those hunting ground (sic)... [Emphasis mine]\n\nHere, I think it's important to reiterate what I stated earlier.  There are degenerates in all walks of life, including the church.  There is no excuse for those who have been abused within the church...any church.\n\nAfter reading so far, I'm glad you tried to draw a distinction between hardcore fundamantal sects (from your own perspective) and conservative Christians, because so far, these articles do not mesh with the breadth of my experience within traditional conservative Christian circles.\n\n**From the USA Today**\nI think we can all agree that Josh Duggar is a deviant.  No excuse.  That doesn't mean all conservative Christians condone or encourage his reprehensible behavior.  I would say, from personal experience within the church, it's just the opposite.\n\nConsider how many stories your read about teacher/student abuse/relationships.  Does that mean we should lump all teachers together as deviants?  Of course not.  Deviants are deviants.  Period.\n\n**From the LA Times**\nThis is an overlap of the article from the Seatle Times piece by Julie Zauzmer, referencing Karthryn Brightbill from the LA Times.  Brightbill is speaking from her own experience, which seems pretty targeted to toward a fairly small subset within fundamentalist communities.  More to the point, however, the \"predatory\" behavior she descibes may be unsavory to many but it is in conjunction with parental approval.  \n\nI'm not defending prearranged marriages of mid-teen girls to men in their 30s.  I'm simply drawing a necessary distinction between true conservative evangelical beliefs and teachings and what is outside of the norm and practiced by some fringe communities.\n\nBefore I continue, I want to add that none of the articles I have read so far directly correlate to Roy Morre's situation.  Sure, they intone that their flavor of fundamentalist teaching fosters an atmosphere of impropriety, but I haven't read one yet that associates Roy Moore with any of these groups, so why are they trying to equate the two? \n\nWhat's more is that Roy Moore is being accused of illegal activity, not simply behavior some may think is out of bounds concerning their young ages, despite parental consent.  Again, I'm not making excuses or defending those fringe elements, just clarifying the difference.  Legal and condoned by parental consent versus illegal.\n\n**From the Independent**\nFirst, this article is - in large measure - talking about relationships involving parental consent, which I addressed above.  Where it goes off the rails, are you kidding me?  Waco, Texas and David Koresh?  C'mon.  That is way out there on the fringe.\n\n**From the Kansas City Star**\nAgain, this is more of the Kathryn Brightbill, Phil Robertson, homeschool fringe stuff.\n\nIn each one of these articles I find one common thread.  Someone has an axe to grind from either their narrow personal experience or their own personal anti-Christian bias.  From there, they make overly broad and harmful generalizations that anyone who is not part of the Christian community may believe reflects the majority.  IT DOES NOT!\n\nAre there deviants in churches today?  Absolutely!  The proof is irrefutable.  But, to make broad generalizations that these fringe groups represent traditional conservative evangelical values is not even remotely true.\n\nThere is repobrate behavior wherever power corrupts, unfortunately.  From Hollywood to DC, churches to schools, power and influence corrupt.  \n\nThat still doesn't mean Roy Moore is guilty of anything.\n\nMore to the point of your comments, none of these articles connect Roy Moore, the main reason I submitted the post, to any of the fringe groups.\n\nIf you remember, my main point was that Mrs. Nelson's own stepson doesn't believe her allegations are true, and that if they were, someone in authority (then) who claims (now) that they knew he was \"creepy\" (then) should have and would have come forward during his many campaigns if the allegations were true.\n",

However, as Frederic Jameson likes to point out, this ideologico-critical dismissal is not enough: in today\u2019s global capitalism, we are all too often dealing with real \u2018conspiracies\u2019. For example, the destruction of the Los Angeles public transport network in the 1950s was not an expression of some 'objective logic of capital\u2019, but the result of an explicit 'conspiracy\u2019 between car companies, road construction companies and public agencies- and the same goes for many 'tendencies\u2019 in contemporary urban development. The dismissal of the 'paranoid\u2019 ideological dimension of conspiracy theories (the supposition of a mysterious all-powerful Master, and so on) should alert us to actual 'conspiracies\u2019 going on all the time. Today, the ultimate ideology would be the self complacent critico-ideological dismissal of all conspiracies as mere fantasies\u2026*\n\n- Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, *Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle*",

It is the overview of their investigation of the Monroe Institute's Gateway Experience. For those who have not heard of the Monroe Institute, they were an organization dedicated to exploring astral projection and mapping put the world one can access through this practice. They developed a method for synchronizing brain activity between the two hemispheres in order to help induce this altered state of consciousness that they named Hemisync, which can be bought from them or \"downloaded\". From what I can tell in their effort to essentially weaponize astral projection the CIA ended up having a reverse Event Horizon experience where they discovered the astral plane in its entirety and discovered many things in the process. The document goes over such subjects as the toroidal nature of our universe and how it explains cosmic inflation, how human consciousness functions, how astral projection actually works, and details on the astral plane itself all from a scientific perspective. The big thing to stand out though is something that they call the Absolute, which they say they found at the end of all the astral dimensions. It is described as having no beginning, no end, no locality, and as infinite conscious energy at rest. It permeates every instance of time and space, existing everywhere and everywhen at once. If that isn't God I don't know what is. \n\n&gt;Read and decide for yourself: https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf\n\n&gt;For those with shorter attention spans, the first mention of the Absolute is in the section titled \"The Time Space Dimension\". I would highly recommend reading it in its entirety however, as you miss crucial info otherwise.\n\n",

A vortex was created in an effort to slip dimensions and become invisible to the enemy. It was a success beyond the highest expectations and launched us all info universal travel. It is no wonder at all that we have had a man on the moon.\n\n&gt;Traveling to distant planets and galaxies is Mickey Mouse stuff in comparison to the high tech wizardry of trans-dimensional travel. Trans-dimensional travel circumvents all measures of time, including distance and speed.\n\n&gt;When the fabric of time was torn, we opened ourselves up to intergalactic travel - both in and out of this dimension - and in and out of the future, as well as the past. We can alter the course of history by traveling back in time to alter events, or we can blast off into the future and gain wisdom and knowledge of events yet to come.\n\n&gt;We can control the future by controlling the past. At present, this is a relatively easy task according to the theory of relativity and abilities gained through the Philadelphia Experiment. I came back an ET (extraterrestrial) myself. And our ship returned to this Earth as a spaceship. I gained the keys to the universe on that fateful day, and I carry them with me now, sharing only a Key or two at a time with those who are Chosen.\n\n&gt;You are a Chosen One (Johnston was deliberately interfacing with Rite to Remain Silent conditioning), and therefore must learn the ins and outs of interplanetary travel. Your mission is trans-dimensional. You can span infinite dimensions by learning from me. Take it from me, you're going places, kiddo. And I'll teach you to get there by riding the light.\n\n&gt;I'll teach you the groundwork, and you do the light work. The key to the universe lies in the speed of light. The only way to travel is by beam of light. You will learn to go to the light...Your mission is to learn how to Tinker with time. I'm going to take you on that journey myself.\n\n&gt;Come with me now. It's time we were leaving this plane and boarding another.\"\n\n---\n\n\n&gt;As the escorts approached, I was relieved to see Kelly with them. Though she was visibly tranced and traumatized, the fact that she was alive was all I was capable of grasping. When she saw the \"Face Changing\" exhibit, she excitedly exclaimed, \"Uncle George [Bush] just read me a book about this!\" Before I could hear anymore, I was led away, leaving Kelly with our handler, Houston.\u00a0\n&gt;I was then quickly taken to Bush's Residence Office, which heretofore was unfamiliar to me.\n\n\u00a0\n---\n\n\n&gt;Claiming to me to be an alien himself, Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like \"alien\" which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes.\u00a0\n\n---\n\n&gt;In one of many White House bedrooms available for such purposes, Bennett led me into bed,\n\n&gt;\"I told you we were going to beat it out of this dimension, and that's exactly what I intend to do. A little Byrd told me you like a whip. Since I am not the Senate kind, I'll just represent the majority by giving you what you need most.\"\n\n&gt;Bennett apparently found perverse pleasure in whipping me. With my wrists bruised and my body stinging with pain, Bennett lit up a cigarette and cryptically asked,\n\n&gt;\"Was that your first cum-union with an alien?\"\n\n&gt;He threw me my clothes, and ordered,\n\n&gt;\"Make yourself presentable. Make sure your wrists are covered. I'm not waiting around for you, I'll see you in the morning.\"\n\n&gt;Bennett left. After awhile I was escorted back to Byrd, with whom I spent a brutal, short night.\n\n\n---\n\n&gt;Early the next morning, deep underground in the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center mind-control lab near D.C., Bill Bennett began preparing me for the program.\n\n---\n\n&gt;A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me, which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party - as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them.\n\n&gt;Not recognizing anyone, I frantically asked,\n\n&gt;\"Who are these people?\"\u00a0\n\n&gt;\"They're not people, and this isn't a spaceship,\" Bennett said.\n\n&gt;As he spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to be lizard-like aliens\n\n\n\n\n\nbibliotecapleyades .net/bb/obrien.htm",

Recognizing the conundrum as one of the great challenges to his theory of evolution by natural selection, Charles Darwin took a stab at accounting for whales in the first edition of Origin of Species. He noted that black bears had been seen swimming with their mouths open for hours at a time on the surface of a lake, feeding on floating insects. \"I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths,\" Darwin concluded, \"till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale.\" His critics poked such loud and gleeful fun at this image, however, that he eventually omitted it from later editions of his book.\n\nNearly a century later George Gaylord Simpson, the preeminent paleontologist of the 20th century, was still at a loss to explain where whales fit in his otherwise orderly evolutionary tree of mammals. \"The cetaceans are on the whole the most peculiar and aberrant of mammals,\" he remarked peevishly. \"There is no proper place for them in a scala naturae. They may be imagined as extending into a different dimension from any of the surrounding orders or cohorts.\"\n\nIf science could not account for the transformation of whales, antievolutionists argued, perhaps it never happened. \n\nIt doesn't explain anything. You just say oh a lot of time passed. Yeah that's the answer for everything. Regardless of time. Why evolve and animal evolve in a sense backward.  You can't account for the traits, and characteristics being for survival, reproduction, mutation, etc. It doesn't make sense.

So in addition to being right about Marxism, I am right about the ideological framework you are coming from.  \n\nI suggest you read the following so you understand why your ideology conceals what is really occurring.\n\n&gt; According to this interpretation, the Jews were identified not merely with money, with the sphere of circulation, but with capitalism itself. However, because of its fetishized form, capitalism did not appear to include industry and technology. Capitalism appeared to be only its manifest abstract dimension which, in turn, was responsible for the whole range of concrete social and cultural changesassociated with the rapid development of modern industrial capitalism. The Jews were not seenmerely as\nrepresentatives\nof capital (in which case anti\n\u2011\nSemitic attacks would have been much moreclass\n\u2011\nspecific). They became the\n personifications\nof the intangible, destructive, immensely powerful, and international domination of capital as an alienated social form. Certain forms of anticapitalist discontent became directed against the manifest abstract dimension of capital personified in the form of the Jews, not because the Jews were consciously identified with the value dimension, but because,given the antinomy of the abstract and concrete dimensions, capitalism appeared that way. The\"anticapitalist\" revolt was, consequently, also the revolt against the Jews. The overcoming of capitalism and its negative social effects became associated with the overcoming of the Jews.\n\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/41252604/Postone-Antisemitism",

Maybe even, it was me, from the far, far reaching future. (Ever seen the movie \"Interstellar\"? If not, watch it on shrooms. Legit. It's absolutely spectacular, and I don't say that lightly.)\n\nThe god I saw (if that even is a good name for it) didn't feel much different than you or I, either. Despite looking visually just like a golden glow I felt a strong sense of recognition and familiarity with it. Your interpretation is just as valid (if not more since it's your experience) than mine though, but I think your interpretation isn't exactly incompatible with mine. \n\nI've never seen interstellar, but reading the plot summary it sounds like a great movie. Despite how much sense it makes to interact with the arts while tripping, I've never really been able to focus on that (in any form, whether that be making art or consuming it). \n\n&gt;But I can say that one time I connected with some sort of dimension, or realm, where all pleasure comes from. If the idea of \"heaven\" or \"nirvana\" is actually real, they I would say that during this specific trip, I connected with it. And I don't mean just being \"drugged out\" and \"euphoric\". I mean that I made a connection with a place of pure bliss.\n\nThis sounds a lot like how I felt, except I interpreted it as some being. I don't know what to call it, but you said it best with \"a connection with a place of pure bliss\". \n\n&gt; It was a beautiful experience that I'll never forget, because I'm always reminded that that place is still out there, whether it was in my head or not, and that regardless of how shitty this world can be, there are places free from the problems we have here.\n\nExactly, this experience for me was only a little over a week ago but the \"high\" (not as in the trip, but as in how it's impacted me) I've felt from this has seemingly already changed me in big ways. I've had trips before this that have changed my perspective and outlook on life, but nothing has changed the way I look at life more than this experience. \n\nI don't know if that feeling is anything I can \"achieve\" (if you look at it like heaven or nirvana) or experience again, but the moment I saw that light I knew it was something I should aim for. Not that I necessarily know where to aim, but aiming to make the world feel as good as I did in that moment seems like the right place to go for. ",

            "body": "Hi. Let me start by saying my experiences are being done by other people around the world. The Astral Dimension is EXTREMELY similar to this one. The belief that it is \"non physical\" is incorrect. I prefer to call it \"semi physical\" and compare it to about 70% of the \"solidity\" of this dimension. It is expanding and forming an overlap/overlay at certain Ley Lines and Vortex Points that it can almost be entered through meditation at this point. Astral Projection and Advanced Lucid Dreaming are occurring in the Astral.\nIt would be easiest to divide it to three sections: 1)The \"Lower Astral\" which is the world of horrific nightmares. Deceased murderers, and people of extremely violent and hateful nature like to congregate in this area. It is also the realm in demonic entities and the sadistic satanic behaviors originated from. 2)The \"Middle Astral\" looks incredibly similar to here. Houses, Buildings, Restaurants and Bars. Yes, I have eaten food, as well as gotten drunk drinking beer there. It seems there is a massive concentration of bars and strip clubs. Because sadly most deceased people tend to gravitate towards addictive and perverse behaviors. Constant Sexual Relations are commonplace and caring relationships seem to be few.",

Which usually stories that have that kind of time travel are more about an ethereal universe, where time doesnt actually exist and is a dimension that can be sidestepped.

A being born within the 4th dimension is straddled to the cap rules of the 4th dimension, but not constricted completely by the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd dimensions. So theoritically, a being born to the 5th dimension would abide by rules that supercede the previous ones but not completely.

You merely construct his actions as anti-globalist while everything you don't like gets ignored.\n\n&gt;8 of 10 richest congress creatures are Dims, if you want to hate on rich people. Limousine liberals, crying crocodile tears for the poor while hording wealth and living in gated mansions.\n\nWhat does this have to do with anti-globalist Trump picking people who paid millions to him in campaign contributions and or people well entrenched in the global banking and oil sector. Looks like a dumb deflection to me. The irony here is certainly that Trump fans link monetary success to skill so per Trump logic the Dem senators should be vastly more capable, right?\n\nSo a straight-up question how is hiring the richest admisnistration ever including half of goldman sachs anti-globalist. How? In which dimension.\n\nYou guys literally create definitions of words after the fact. You couldn't even define what globalist is. If you would it would exactly be what Trump now does and not what you would have described two years ago. \n\nTo my knowledge, he hasn't backed out on any trade deal. He scrapped a deal that wasn't even done.... . Why is he still in NAFTA?",

I was playing around with something called \"magic squares\".... its basically like Sudoku where the lines all add up to the same, but you can connect the numbers in lines to form these sigils. After doing one and forgetting about it for few minitues I realized that I was feeling very hot, head tingly, and strange smell.... it freaked me out and I thought I was getting zapped by those microwave rays from cuba lol, so I left my room and it stopped. Realized it was the sigil and tore up the paper. \n\nThe interesting thing about them is that I';m sure its easy to hide in pictures and video clips, esp because it can be encoded with numbers as well as shapes. I wouldn't be surprised if some logos in magazines used them in some way, or possibly signatures. Another thing to look out for is strange hummm sounds in videos, people can put in theta waves that make your brain more receptive to ideas.... I think people sneak these in to propaganda type videos. \n\nAnd on a more sci-fi level.... I have a personal theory that cern/quantum computers have basically made it possible for group consciousness, and this recent spike in scare tactics, kek or trump shit is all to get people to think a certain way which could make an idea turn into reality, shifting us into a dimension where things like ufos or a tsunami is more possible. Something like that. \n\nI also think apple iphones are warping peoples brains. I have noticed my friends and family members with iphones have been acting odd in past 2 yrs or so, more distant less empathetic and easily brainwashed by media. People say the quartz crystals used in these phones form a link with us and possibly open up a communication channel of sorts. ",

(Which is why I didn't respond earlier or properly. The video is certainly cool, you should check out this VSauce video on this very topic, I think you'd like it  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IJhgZBn-LHg) \n\nI understand what you're saying. But beyond cool I fail to see the significance of how planets, asteroids, comets and all the other celestial object orbiting our sun move through the universe. \n\nIt's not even perfectly helical. You have to consider the perturbances that each planet has on each other and the possible perturbances caused by nearby passing stars. These will change the orbits slightly and make them imperfect. \n\nMy other issue is that if you look at any object in the sky for long enough and you'll notice a pattern emerge. Sometimes there are patterns within patterns. It's just the nature of the universe. Patterns form over time. It happens. \n\nAlso, it's not a double helix created by the planets. There's 8 planets so that's 8 helices. Plus the thousands of other helices being creates by all the other objects orbiting the sun. There's nothing inherently special about the helix. I'm not aware of any research into why it's a good shape for DNA but I'm sure it's out there. \n\nThe universe naturally tends towards the easiest solution, it requires less energy, so without an outside injection of energy, systems, whether it's DNA or the orbits of celestial objects, will naturally find an equilibrium and form an eventual pattern. We see it everywhere.  Biology, weather, astronomy, at the atomic level, hell, even our own behaviour and the systems we create produce patterns given enough time. \n\nSo I get you. I just don't buy it. And you're still using terms like dimension and measurement wrong. \n\nIf you haven't, I do recommend going and learning some calculus and then from there physics and engineering. All of these things you talk about are simple mathematically expressible models. These models are far from accurate but they conform to patterns, just like the universe. It's why maths is so useful in describing almost everything. \n\nNow I would be interested in hearing why you think any of this proves anything other than humans are fierce pattern recognition machines, and what that conclusion might be. \n\n",

            "body": "Oh yeah, mandela effect, let me put it straight. Said people decided to look at life like paintings inside the temple of walls of antarctica, collectively, many powerful, people, with the control of the media to release similar content in the media reinforcing the fact that it's there. Next, we have those black walls, (i love the round thingeys) that are impermeable to radar, sonar, infrared, x ray, any electronic devices in general. Human consciousness is very unique and can exist at multi dimensions... Even with the observer effect we see that if it is not observed it is uncertain, but when observed it becomes absolute. So essentially, by solving very complex puzzles that require you to LOOK at ALOT of different points on earths histories and locations, it essentially timelocks everyone to the point of revelations. That big planet in the sky is a tank, for the fish they caught online. \n\nSo essentially some time can be altered, great, some tiny miniscule events can be altered without the intervention of people I don't even want to mess with, because they will fix it ANY way they can, or try to protect themselves for the suffering of others, not my problem. \n\nMy problem is that one motherfucker hiding under the surface of antarctica or wherever the bible said he was, he will come out and make you worship him and shit and you guys can do that fine, but all he is looking for is things to burn for his illusion in a hellish dimension which we created for sadist, psychopathic fucks. My job, is to break the machine, since the beginning of time itself despite my lack of knowledge of how much I may have caused since the beginning of time itself. That itself is a gift from God, but the spirit remains the same every fucking time, fack. I would like these machines or sadists to realize they are brooms with the handles replaced many many times, and somehow you stuffed a bit of humanity inside yourselves to feel like everyone else but you are really not. Out of 13.5 billion years you don't think advanced aliens know how to really work the machine until it explodes for the rest of time to create energy for the heaven for the people you made suffer? Your infliction of hell for 80 years or less is incomparable to the rest of time itself. Your are all just literal batteries. You are just a clockwork droid hellbent on making others suffer for the rest of time itself while someone with a real consciousness has to make a big decision for God's greater good. (Not freemasonry, this church is described in revelations and prophecies as the greatest evil in the world right now. Good job guys!) What defines a species is HOW much VALUE you place on a SENTIENT life form, so think of revelations like chemotherapy, except the many cancers/virus' of this world are going to have a lot of a worse time based on the data we have gathered. \n\nJust a messenger, and possibly a future glorious antarctic monster fighter but hey, what's the universe if you can't inflict ancient polar good and positive life experiences on as many sentient beings as you can, just do your best. \n\nHere is an analogy for you controllers and bots and people just doing your job...\n\nThink league of legends, there are champions and minions. By eliminating the other teams minions, you get rewarded with new equipment etc. But the real direction of the game is determined by the champions who exist on a completely different level. The minions, though if the champions get bored get attacked by their mana costing abilities but hey abilities look cool don't they? That's the whole reality everyone's in. Lovely isn't it? \n\nImagine if we used abilities on you because of small shit we did, that would be childish.\nRemember what ancient roman and greek mythology said about the demigods or \"gods\" themselves? They said they were childish. Beats me, maybe stories are stories or very altered forgotten memories. Fuck with God and you will get the full force of his hammer of judgement. ",

It is the overview of their investigation of the Monroe Institute's Gateway Experience. For those who have not heard of the Monroe Institute, they were an organization dedicated to exploring astral projection and mapping put the world one can access through this practice. They developed a method for synchronizing brain activity between the two hemispheres in order to help induce this altered state of consciousness that they named Hemisync, which can be bought from them or \"downloaded\". From what I can tell in their effort to essentially weaponize astral projection the CIA ended up having a reverse Event Horizon experience where they discovered the astral plane in its entirety and discovered many things in the process. The document goes over such subjects as the toroidal nature of our universe and how it explains cosmic inflation, how human consciousness functions, how astral projection actually works, and details on the astral plane itself all from a scientific perspective. The big thing to stand out though is something that they call the Absolute, which they say they found at the end of all the astral dimensions. It is described as having no beginning, no end, no locality, and as infinite conscious energy at rest. It permeates every instance of time and space, existing everywhere and everywhen at once. If that isn't God I don't know what is. \n\n&gt;Read and decide for yourself: https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf\n\n&gt;For those with shorter attention spans, the first mention of the Absolute is in the section titled \"The Time Space Dimension\". I would highly recommend reading it in its entirety however, as you miss crucial info otherwise.\n\n",

He is an extra-dimensional being of unknown origin who is unconstrained by, and possesses immeasurable power over, normal human notions of time, space, the laws of physics, and even reality itself, being capable of violating or altering any or all of them in unpredictable ways with a casual thought or hand gesture, limited only by his imagination. Despite his vast knowledge and experience spanning untold eons (and much to the exasperation of the object(s) of his obsession), he is not above practical jokes for his own personal amusement, for some otherwise unfathomably Machiavellian and manipulative purpose, or simply to prove a point. He is said to be nigh-omnipotent, and he is continually evasive regarding his true motivations.\n\n&gt; The name \"Q\" applies not only to the names of the individuals portrayed (all \"male\" and \"female\" characters refer to each other as \"Q\"), it also applies to the name of their race and to the Q Continuum itself \u2013 an alternate dimension accessible to only the Q and their \"invited\" guests.

One has a different point of view at different elevations. Anyone who has ever looked from the same horizontal distance at a low and high elevation will confirm this.     \n\n\nI feel like this has got a bit off topic so I am gonna close by again encouraging you to perform the experiment detailed in my conversation links for yourself.    \n      \n\nTake care o/\n\n\n\n",

I get the sense that these forces have been in intense conflict lately, as if perhaps mimicked on our wavelength.\n\nI think it began due to benevolent Greys deciding to end a peace agreement with reptilians. I believe this happened due to a rogue element of Greys collaborating with reptilians to, in the view of benevolent Greys, negatively effect humanity.\n\nIt was understood amongst these forces that our dimension was to be maintained for the purpose of observation. I think that's our whole purpose- to be observed. We are created from whatever they were created from. They wish to learn about themselves so we're the experiment in the vacuum teaching them of us.\n\nBoth sides realized soon in this experiment that we are more than lab rats, we are actually the original creators. Reptilians reacted to this by wanting to destroy us- knowing that due to our potential we may end up destroying them. Some Greys agree- hence the  rogue element. Most Greys reacted to this knowledge by wanting to support us , protect us. \n\nThe reptiles couldn't overtly destroy us for they would be outted instantly. Therefore they had to corrupt the experiment- if u will- hence the few reptiles u mentioned disguised as humans. They felt that if they could make their sabotage look like the act of humans, the Greys would rethink their original conclusion and support our destruction.\n\nThe truth was revealed, and now it's been war.\n\n:) ",

It was a war that involved too many countries, the dimension of the victory of David was unprecedented in History.  \nNo wonder, that victory was a milestone in the History of End Times.  \nSo the illuminati just erased it from the memory of their sheep, by keeping silent about it.  \nEspecially important in Israel, as the illuminati gave back the Sinai 20 years ago, the milestone setting the foundations for the new process, the destruction of Israel. \n\n&gt; They've been kicked out of every country they've been in for a reason.\n\nReminder:  \n**2015 May: Illuminati mystified by how against all odds Israel was not yet destroyed**\nOctober 20, 2011, Libya - Gaddafi, first illuminati agent playing head of state to be executed in this millennium, immediately after his arrest.  \n2012 - illuminazi agent Morsi paraded in Germany by Hitler's younger daughter Angela months after denying the holocaust and promising to make Jerusalem the new capital of Egypt.  \nYet one year later 30 million Egyptians in the streets forced the illuminati to replace the puppet and temporarily change the rhetoric.\n\n**How mystifying is this for the illuminati?**   \nAs much as:  \n1. The creation of Israel against all odds and only 3 years after Illuminati Grand Master Hitler failed to complete the holocaust of the Jews.\n\n2. Israel's military victories against the aggression of the surrounding states in 4 wars, before finally the illuminati infiltrators took control of Israel gov, 1975.\n\nAt this point the destruction of Israel was no longer a question of how but only of when.  \n3. Spring 2011: all pieces are in place to finally destroy Israel, from Egypt to Turkey.  \nIran loudly promises to wipe Israel off the map with \"thousands of rockets pointed at Telaviv\", \"experts warn that Iran might have already nuclear bombs\".  \nBut it's Assad in Syria who has the real deal, what everyone keeps silence about, starting with the Israeli traitors: one of the world's largest arsenals of chemical weapons.  \nThat's when illuminati watch in disbelief the start of the Arab Spring.  \nAt the end of the day Assad's arsenal was exposed by the real World War III coming to Syria: nazi puppet governments resorting to bomb its own civilians with barrel bombs, chlorine and choke gas.  \nAs for the treasonous Israeli nazi puppet government, they just keep totally silent about it, so the Jewish cattle won't add 1+1.   \n\n&gt; The US has welcomed them  \n\nThe US/NATO \"govs\" are illuminati puppet governments actively participating in the \"destruction of Israel\" agenda, despite what the totally controlled media and web of disinformation propagate.  \nTo understand that fact, all it takes is to remember that the illuminati (NATziO &amp; Co.) supplied Assad with one of the world's largest arsenals of chemical weapons (and Iran with long range missiles) to wipe Israel off the map.\n\n&gt; they're destroying it from the inside out  \n\nCorrect, TRAITORS are illuminati's most important weapon.  \nThis includes the treasonous Israeli \"gov\", not to mention Iran/Russia/\"US led coalition\" &amp; Co.",

I am a luthier, so the study of frequencies is a natural outgrowth of my work. It has led me down a rabbit hole that is quite fascinating. There was a post about a project done by the CIA or one of the IC's about the nature of reality and how to transcend our reality. There was talk of the \"Plank's distance\". That distance was described as the distance a particle travels during its transitional phase at the extremes of it's vibrational frequency. During a particles' vibrations, it has to change direction twice during each cycle, during which it is essentially still and thus outside of our perceivable realm. They were developing or had developed a means of attaining this state so as to effectively transcend this dimension into other dimensions for the purposes of time travel, ESP, etc. \nLove your username. I play guitar and have been looking into the 432 tuning. Can you give me any info? or where to go to find out more. I have looked at a lot of YT videos and such, but most of the videos just analyze the 432 hz vs the 440 hz concert pitch. Can't find any that actually delve into playing music with the 432 hz basis.",

As much as I don't like Flat Earth Asshole, (b/c he is an annoying AF asshole) he has that broken record point of the AE model not working. He doesn't provide anything more to counter point, or bring anything productive to the table in place though.\n\nAll this/these anomalies are what keep me running back to your simulation theory point of this post. Either the entire world/our paradigm is a simulation, or the sun, moon, and sky are simulations. Or there are multiple suns.\n\nI recently saw as of today that there are people like Darren Nesbit proposing that there is possibly a fourth dimension spacetime loop of the sky, which from what I gather basically means it is its own simulation, so to speak, so we don't have to be \"NPC's,\" in someone else's video game.\n\nThat theory could explain how the day times work in every time zone, how the sky is a repeatable cycle, how the sun moves on every continent, and all of the anomalies that can't be explained 100% on either sphere earth, or AE flat earth model.\n\n",

            "body": "Yes, first of all: your soul, or rather everyone's soul is immortal. \nDon't quit on me yet. \nEveryone is in this life to learn certain lessons from life (for example: to love deeper, to be able to let loved ones go free, to put other beings before things, etc.). So your soul enters your body upon birth like a driver entering a car. You yourself have chosen exactly this time to experience life in the third dimension under the given circumstances. When your earthly body dies your soul will go back to the astral plane to review experiences, recover and choose another point of incarnation to either learn new lessons, or if you failed to learn the lessons presented to you, repeat the same lessons. You forget everything about this at birth because it is important that understanding comes from within, so in order for you to learn your lessons you have to come up with the solutions without external influences. So usually when you see yourself constantly confronted with one kind of problem, this is most probably your lesson for this incarnation, and you will face this same kind of problem until you deal with it and then it will magically vanish and you will receive other problems. I hope you are still with me.\nDuring your evolution and all actions you take, you can choose between two polarities: service to self(exploit other beings to raise your power/status/whatever) or service to others without expecting anything in return. Everything you do drives you towards one of the polarities. In certain timeframes there is a harvest for souls occurring where everyone gets evaluated in terms of their polarity, in order to advance to the next dimension. \nYou have to be 95% negative, so really selfish and exploiting towards others, to advance into the next negative dimension, or 51% positive to enter the next positive dimension. If you are somewhere in-between you will stay in third dimension and have to continue lessons there. \nAccording to various messages this time is upon us somewhere from 100 to 700 years in time. Since the harvest is meant to be very fruitful, things start to escalate more, so as many people as possible get driven towards any polarity.\n\nSo here comes the conspiracy: If you are negatively oriented and want to be more and more oriented in that direction you come up with ways to exploit other beings better, most importantly a system of money, government, you name it. Everything that enables power over others is a means to increase your negative polarity, and by promoting consumer mentality you drive people to head towards negative polarity themselves to gain more money / power. And all the other conspiracies you see all around you, are a direct result of this chase of polarity. And if you already made it to fourth or fifth dimension negative you might deem it worthwhile to enslave populations of other planets (for example earth) and promote the negative ways, so you can further increase your negative polarity.",

On what basis does the writer make this claim?  Oh that's right on one of Einstein's theories.\n\nI mean it's already possible to time travel.  I don't know the math but I do believe it's already been proven mathematically.  \n\nI'll explain:  \nAs some person, place, or thing (we'll call it person A) approaches the speed of light time slows down - but here's the important part....relatively.  What does that mean?  It slows down relative to another person, place, or thing (we'll call that person B) that is moving at speed slower than person A.  \n\nPerson B acts as a point of reference from which to measure time but that doesn't mean that Person A isn't also a point of reference.  From the point of reference of Person A, time progresses the exact same way it always has and only after returning to Person B will Person A see that time has indeed moved at different speeds for both.  If there is a 3rd person moving with Person A (we'll call that Person C) - person A and C will experience normal time passing between them...no change.  It's only when it's related to a different reference point (person B) that things are indeed quite different.\n\nSo Einstein says that space and time are related and intricately locked in something called space-time.

A living rose and a dead rose have the same chemical composition, but one gives off a scent and the other does not. You can explain it away with physical properties until the cows come home, but the subjective experience of that rose, you're correct, can't be fully explained in one word. **All** the words won't do.  \n  \nAs a kid I used to wonder why, if God was in the sky, you couldn't see him.

It stops neither at your skin, nor the ionosphere, nor the ground.  \n  \nSearching for God is chasing your tail. The very act pushes it away.",

And, so what if Carr is working with vulnerable women - she is in fact in an ideal place to help vulnerable women as she has been where they are, in a bullying relationship living with a monster. Who better to help women than a woman who has been a victim herself?\n\nR1ck3o's request for donations to fight legal costs that may ensue from his unsubstantiated claims adds another dimension to this.\n\nLooks to me like R1ck3o has taken to two of the most emotive child abuse cases in recent history, made up some unsubstantiated bs and then asked for donations to fight a legal case which as yet has not been made.\n\nLets face it, if R1ck3o really had published images of the real John Venebles, the police would have his site shut down and R1ck3o charged with perverting the course of justice or contempt.\n\nThe images are still up, as are R1ck3o's unproven, unsubstantiated claims - no case has been launched by either the CPS or police.\n\nAnd R1cj3o's requests for donations 'to fight the good fight' are still live.\n\nR1ck3o is a scam artist peddling lies and deception with unsubstantiated claims hoping to get people to give him \u00a3.\n\nMost of his posts on this are deleted, his account on Dif has been deleted (and they don't usually do that) so the mods there are on to him.\n\nInvestigate it yourself, see if R1ck3o's claims add up - i have, and i have found that his claims don't hold water.\n\nAsk why R1ck3o has a number of websites, all registered at different addresses and ask if someone who posts unsubstantiated claims, then asks for \u00a3 to fund a legal case that 'might' be bought because of those claims is genuine.\n",

            "body": "Some quotes from her book. \n\n\n&gt;He referred to a picture of himself shaking hands with unknown Navy brass as he dramatically told me,\n\n&gt;\"I was there that fateful day in 1943 when a hole was ripped in the fabric of time through what later became known as the Philadelphia Experiment.\n\n&gt;All those fine boys vanished along with their ship in a bizarre twist of events that parallels the Atlantis disappearances. A vortex was created in an effort to slip dimensions and become invisible to the enemy. It was a success beyond the highest expectations and launched us all info universal travel. It is no wonder at all that we have had a man on the moon.\n\n&gt;Traveling to distant planets and galaxies is Mickey Mouse stuff in comparison to the high tech wizardry of trans-dimensional travel. Trans-dimensional travel circumvents all measures of time, including distance and speed.\n\n&gt;When the fabric of time was torn, we opened ourselves up to intergalactic travel - both in and out of this dimension - and in and out of the future, as well as the past. We can alter the course of history by traveling back in time to alter events, or we can blast off into the future and gain wisdom and knowledge of events yet to come.\n\n&gt;We can control the future by controlling the past. At present, this is a relatively easy task according to the theory of relativity and abilities gained through the Philadelphia Experiment. I came back an ET (extraterrestrial) myself. And our ship returned to this Earth as a spaceship. I gained the keys to the universe on that fateful day, and I carry them with me now, sharing only a Key or two at a time with those who are Chosen.\n\n&gt;You are a Chosen One (Johnston was deliberately interfacing with Rite to Remain Silent conditioning), and therefore must learn the ins and outs of interplanetary travel. Your mission is trans-dimensional. You can span infinite dimensions by learning from me. Take it from me, you're going places, kiddo. And I'll teach you to get there by riding the light.\n\n&gt;I'll teach you the groundwork, and you do the light work. The key to the universe lies in the speed of light. The only way to travel is by beam of light. You will learn to go to the light...Your mission is to learn how to Tinker with time. I'm going to take you on that journey myself.\n\n&gt;Come with me now. It's time we were leaving this plane and boarding another.\"\n\n---\n\n\n&gt;As the escorts approached, I was relieved to see Kelly with them. Though she was visibly tranced and traumatized, the fact that she was alive was all I was capable of grasping. When she saw the \"Face Changing\" exhibit, she excitedly exclaimed, \"Uncle George [Bush] just read me a book about this!\" Before I could hear anymore, I was led away, leaving Kelly with our handler, Houston.\u00a0\n&gt;I was then quickly taken to Bush's Residence Office, which heretofore was unfamiliar to me.\n\n\u00a0\n---\n\n\n&gt;Claiming to me to be an alien himself, Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like \"alien\" which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes.\u00a0\n\n---\n\n&gt;In one of many White House bedrooms available for such purposes, Bennett led me into bed,\n\n&gt;\"I told you we were going to beat it out of this dimension, and that's exactly what I intend to do. A little Byrd told me you like a whip. Since I am not the Senate kind, I'll just represent the majority by giving you what you need most.\"\n\n&gt;Bennett apparently found perverse pleasure in whipping me. With my wrists bruised and my body stinging with pain, Bennett lit up a cigarette and cryptically asked,\n\n&gt;\"Was that your first cum-union with an alien?\"\n\n&gt;He threw me my clothes, and ordered,\n\n&gt;\"Make yourself presentable. Make sure your wrists are covered. I'm not waiting around for you, I'll see you in the morning.\"\n\n&gt;Bennett left. After awhile I was escorted back to Byrd, with whom I spent a brutal, short night.\n\n\n---\n\n&gt;Early the next morning, deep underground in the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center mind-control lab near D.C., Bill Bennett began preparing me for the program.\n\n---\n\n&gt;A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me, which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party - as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them.\n\n&gt;Not recognizing anyone, I frantically asked,\n\n&gt;\"Who are these people?\"\u00a0\n\n&gt;\"They're not people, and this isn't a spaceship,\" Bennett said.\n\n&gt;As he spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to be lizard-like aliens\n\n\n\n",

Well in that case yes I've taken them many times, and they've benefited my life greatly. I personally feel that everyone deserves to have at least one psychedelic experience in their lifetime, and new research is showing that people almost universally benefit from it.\n\nThat said, I don't think that what I saw as a child was \"god\". I think it was a being not much different than you or I. Maybe even, it was me, from the far, far reaching future. (Ever seen the movie \"Interstellar\"? If not, watch it on shrooms. Legit. It's absolutely spectacular, and I don't say that lightly.)\n\nI don't think I've ever connected with \"god\" or \"the source\" on psychedelics before. I'm not sure that's even possible. But I can say that one time I connected with some sort of dimension, or realm, where all pleasure comes from. If the idea of \"heaven\" or \"nirvana\" is actually real, they I would say that during this specific trip, I connected with it. And I don't mean just being \"drugged out\" and \"euphoric\". I mean that I made a connection with a place of pure bliss. It was a beautiful experience that I'll never forget, because I'm always reminded that that place is still out there, whether it was in my head or not, and that regardless of how shitty this world can be, there are places free from the problems we have here.

            "body": "Hmm interesting.\n\nI feel I should note that I am no sort of expert on theology or Christianity or such.  I have spent more time reading philosophy than religion, but I have read some of the Bible as well as various theological tales on applying Christianity to philosophy such as Aquinas (who is always on my \u201cget around to reading more\u201d list) and...  I can\u2019t think of the name, but he is a British contemporary Catholic thinker in that sort of area of study.  I also grew up in a loosely Christian family (as in went to Sunday school as a kid and had children\u2019s bible but later we only occasionally attended church) and had much more religious grandparents from whom I heard religious theory for much longer.\n\nAlright, background aside:\n\n\n1). I don\u2019t see why it couldn\u2019t, but that really sounds more like the pantheistic or philosophical approach to the problem.  Actually, that sounds a lot like... was it Plato?  I will need to look it up but there is a Greek philosopher who essentially argued that from a non-Christian perspective.\n\nTo note, my grandparents were fond of listening to preachers on the radio and I recall one part of a sermon that stuck in my mind as a youngster.  I believe it was from one of those \u201cprosperity doctrine\u201d type mega church guys who essentially said \u201cThe classic vision of hell as fire and torture and such isn\u2019t what the real hell is like.  In reality Hell is to be separated from God, to understand the truth and to know his love and to know that you are forever outside of it.\u201d  An interesting take and when considered at length a pretty hellish vision...  psychological torture is the most potent.  This could also be somewhat applied to more new-agey beliefs as well and seems to come equally from Buddhist thought oddly enough.\n\n2) I really haven\u2019t given that idea much thought but, now doing so, don\u2019t give it much credence.  For one, if God created Satan to rid himself of evil, this means that he has given Satan a trait that he does not himself possess.  This would implied that Satan could act beyond God\u2019s authority or power or knowledge since to truly be rid of evil, one could no longer comprehend evil.  You must be able possess the capacity for anything you are able to consider; if you can imagine or conceive of the idea of a person willingly raping a child, or understand that this has taken place, you also have the capacity to rape a child.  \n\nThis could be said to define free will.  If you cannot conceive of evil you cannot chose not to do it.  This is also where both the ideas of original sin and the idea of animals not having a soul derive.  The free will is clear.  The animal part considers that animals act without malice or understanding; if a dog rapes or kills a puppy it cannot be said to be evil because the dog has no innate understanding of right or wrong, they are merely driven by animalistic urges.  (Note I don\u2019t necessarily agree with this, we are constantly learning that animals possess far greater cognitive function than we gave them credit for and I think we are *still* underestimating them.  Cetaceans get the focus, but if you are interested I find elephants *far* more fascinating because they demonstrate advanced abstract thought and are more readily observed interacting with humans and other animals.)\n\nFurther, I would ask, what need would God as described by Christianity have for ridding himself of evil?  He is everything and possesses everything and everything comes from him.  Why, at some point in time, would he decide to remove something from himself?  Of course this leads further to asking why any of God\u2019s actions in the Bible take place, why create the enormous test for man with end times and revelations and all that simply to get to a point he could bring about instantly?  Why allow Satan to betray him?  Or man to fall?  Or earth to exist externally from himself?  You see what I mean?\n\nPerhaps a better way to imagine God\u2019s perspective would be an \u201cinter dimensional\u201d approach as seeing people as a uniform object combining all possible past present and futures as a sort of single thing, I suppose much like a branching tree, yet the single path one takes is the free will you exercise.  This is a sort of quantum mechanics view I guess.  When observed at one point in time all other possible locations would collapse, but if viewed from the perspective of God all other possibilities also still exist.  This can lead to an entire rabbit hole in and of itself as to whether all people on earth are actually a single entity expressed across every dimension and we are in fact all Jesus as the aspect of the son of god...  it resolves the population growth problem of ideas about reincarnation.\n\nAnyway, that is what comes to mind.\n\nOh, one last thing that comes to mind worth noting is that I think it is a common mistake when considering ancient cultures or beliefs to falsely imagine them as less mentally sophisticated than ourselves.  Technology has grown and with it the vocabulary of words or ideas that we use to express concepts, but our ability to think and the way we think has not become any more sophisticated at all.  It is worth the attempt to look at mystery schools and occultism and religions less as something complete or different and more as ways of explaining things we now understand in different words.  ",

The questions I could ask now are questions that have already been done to death regarding this topic. \n\nIf God created everything, he created Lucifer. Why would he create his own enemy? Boredom? As a \"test\" for humans? If God loves us why play test games with us? Why setup your own kids to fail? You just said that man is an enemy to God. Doesn't sound so kind and loving to me. \n\nBut if it's all just a big game, a test, what's my reward? To die and live next to god on a cloud somewhere? A different planet or dimension maybe? Sounds boring TBH. Maybe theres more to do there then? \n\nAnd if it's all a big test, that means I have to pass it. But you said I don't have to do anything. No amount of work on my part passes the test. Doesn't make sense. \n\nAnd if all that is just a simple, apparent, obvious, and beautiful truth then why is it all so complicated, contradictory to itself, and need so many explanations. \n\nTruth is simple. When you see it you know it. Christianity just isn't that way is it? Or it would have a larger conversion rate and retention rate. Once again it appears that FE theory is simple another flavor to Christianity. I dont know any other religious groups in on the FE movement. Reeks of religious fervor, not facts. \n\n",

Explained here:\nhttp://defeatingthebeast.com/quantum-computing-sciences-new-ouija-board/\n\nThen we go into CERN. The claim is that CERN can produce strangelets. Strangelets should be the most stably matter and all other matter is unstable and so it attracks that other matter. This would be comparable to the forming of a neutron star. Now the next thing is that it is build at Saint-Genus-Poilly which would be a differentiaded name of Appolliacum. Temple to Appollo. Romans at that time used to believe there was a gateway to the underworld there. To put 2+2 together. CERN would be made to open the portal to another dimension.\n\nThen the connections with history.\n These type of events have been recorded/written about all over history.

Consciousness in Perspective. \n\nHaving ascertained that human consciousness is able to separate from physical reality and interact with other intelligences in other dimensions within the universe, and that it is both eternal and designed for ultimate return to the Absolute, we are faced with the question: \u201cSo what happens then?\u201d Since memory is a function of consciousness and therefore enjoys the same eternal character as the consciousness which accounts for its existence, it must be admitted that when consciousness returns to the Absolute, it brings with it all the memories it has accumulated through experience in reality. The return of consciousness to the Absolute does not imply and extinction of the separate entity which the consciousness organized and sustained in reality. \n\nRather, it suggests a differentiated consciousness which merges with and participates in the universal consciousness and infinity of the Absolute without losing the separate identity and accumulated self-knowledge which its memories confer upon it. What it does lose is the capability for generation of independent thought holograms, since that can be done only by energy in motion. In other words, it retains the power to perceive but loses the power of will or choice. In exchange, however, this consciousness participates in the all-knowing infinite continuum of consciousness which is a characteristic of energy in the ever present. Consequently, it is accurate to observe that when a person experiences the out-of-body state, they are, in fact, projecting that eternal spark of consciousness and memory which constitutes the ultimate source of their identity to let it play in and learn from dimensions both inside and outside the time-space world in which their physical component currently enjoys a short period of reality.\"",

            "body": "Also see /r/paradigmchange/  \n\nI am a major in Physics, and became sensitive for the paranormal a bit after my studies. Since then I am studying the aura and chi, and try to put it into scientific concepts. The major problem with science today is that it it does not like new ideas.  \n\nThe model that I observe is that there are more dimensions. This is physically possible without any problems. The physical body is surrounded by an multidimensional aura. It works like a second body. \n\nThe aura is observable as a flame-like body. What you are observing is the chi / life-energy flowing through the body. But if you follow the flow, it follows a line-structure. These lines are known in the yoga as nadis, but this repeats on all dimensions. \n\nEverything is connected with each other trough these lines/channels. At certain places they connect with each other and go through nodes, which act like ports to the next level of the aura.\n\nEach level of the aura goes deeper into a unity of consciousness. Be aware: there are many levels of this unity, and that can be confusing as the religions show us. The different levels connect unity all the way to our physical body.\n\nNow it is interesting that we see this same structure back in our body. Within our cells we have microtubules that control/guide processes in the cells, and communication between cells.\n\nIt seems that these processes and communication can be disturbed with electromagnetic waves, when they are in resonance with it. But that is a whole other story on its own.\n\nOn lower level we see that molecules are connected via electrons. And on the deepest known level the quarks are connected via gluons. There seem to be 2 more physical levels, but that needs some more research.\n\nThe multidimensional network model, based on observations, connects consciousness and physics in one model. In this model we have some kind of free will, as we experience, and can consciousness influence the physical body as we can observe. Also can physical substances influence the psyche. It goes both ways.\n\nWith this model, I can understand most psychiatric problems. Your consciousness can have problems on different levels of existence. I am now actively helping people with severe problems like psychosis and depression. I also get insight in how psychopaths work, and how we can help them and us with this disease.\n\nThe multidimensional models can also explain all paranormal events that I know exist. Ghosts can move in and out of our physical observed dimension. Probably there are many more multidimensional creatures. We can influence (with enough training) the physical world that we connect with. I can heat something with my hands. There are also tricksters that try to pretend they can do these things, so it is best to learn it yourself via chi.\n\nBut there is also the problem with sceptics. They seem to be very afraid of the multidimensional aspect of this reality. I usually see that they have problems with some multidimensional beings that parasite on them and their thinking. And from this fear and problems they react aggressively towards these ideas. Tip: Just have an open mind, explore these ideas and find out for yourself.\n",

They arise naturally in relation to geometric structures on manifolds and smooth varieties, and in many other settings. See Chern-Simons theory for an example of how three-dimensional topological quantum field theory plays a role in the classification of three-dimensional manifolds with embedded knots and links. There is a similar story happening with string theories/M-theory. The geometric setting where this happens is much deeper, perhaps related to the \"exceptional\" structures in algebra and geometry.

            "body": "That's why I asked you to define magic. It's a more difficult task than it appears on the surface, isn't it?\n\nAt some point (arguably one we already passed) we'll use technology which we can utilize and use correctly without actually understanding how it works. Quantum computing and machine learning are two emerging fields that promise to become hugely beneficial and useful to our development as a species (if we somehow manage not to kill ourselves with it), which already work in ways we don't fully comprehend. This creates a kind of grey area of meaning between science/technology and magic.\n\nI see your point about the questionable effectiveness of prayer or things like synchronized meditations. On the other hand, we have phenomena such as the [100th monkey effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDAuE6j9s6k), which strongly hints at a fundamental interconnectedness between geographically separated minds of the same species of animal. That is nature doing magic, in my honest opinion, because what the hell else are you gonna call that?\n\n&gt; What entity would decide what \"prayers\" are answered to the affirmative?\n\nThat's a complex question, and I guess you ask it rhetorically. I find it interesting enough that I'm trying to formulate an answer to it anyway.\n\nI used to be an Atheist. Before that, as a child, God made perfect sense to me, but the more I learned about Catholicism (the religion I grew up with) and the world, the more the disconnection between what I felt to be true and what I was told to be true grew. I've since found that spark again, that connection I felt so naturally as a kid. It still disappears at times, but I know where to find it again, and my life has drastically improved. The thing is, though, that my God has virtually nothing to do with God as \"he\" is being portrayed by the church or by most religious interpreters. The closest description of the God which I know to be true is the Force, unsurprisingly enough, seeing how that story resonates with the spirit of the masses like hardly anything else does. \n\nSo I wouldn't necessarily call God an entity, any more than I would call a river a sentient being (which it very well may be, from a certain point of view). God, to me, is a river that I trust will lead me through the jungle to the ocean. Others may not have that trust, you'll find them clinging to rocks they were once pushed up or smashed against. Others again will swim as hard as they can against the stream, half drowning themselves and others in their panicked efforts to withstand live's directions. Some will swim ashore and wander the woods, for a time, or forever. \n\nTo walk before (or with) God means nothing more than to swim with the current that moves you forward while paying enough attention that you don't get yourself killed in the rapids.\n\nWhen I broke my spine, I didn't pray for God to make me better, I prayed to God for the strength to heal myself and recover as far as he'll allow me to. Today I can walk again. I can play the fucking drums again, after several years with wheelchair and crutches. And I understand now that my recovery was largely due to how I framed my request at the time, because it was conditional on my own efforts to heal myself as far as God/circumstances permit. I made a pact with the Unknown that I would give this thing my all in exchange for the trust that I will have the strength to follow through and endure and so on, with the humble acceptance that it's always possible that I just won't come very far despite my efforts, as is tragically so often the case.\n\nSo, it's just not the case that simply believing in or praying to God makes everything holy and it cures cancer and makes you walk again. Especially if all you're doing is repeating mantras over and over, hoping for a miracle to arise (though that kind of praying can be meditative and thus beneficial too). In my view, the point at which true divine magic can occur is when you honestly ask \"the void\" what you can do to get your act together, whatever that means to you, and then heed the answer that comes to you. \n\nSo in that kind of framework, prayer can be the single most important thing you do in your life. I think that's approximately the framework in which most Freemasons understand religion too btw. \n\nSorry for rambling on this tangent, but it's still a question that occupies my mind a lot because I have had such an immediate experience with it, and I'm still continuously processing how my life has progressed since my injury.\n\n&gt; I would not attribute \"crop circles\" to magic. Something had to cause them. I cannot imagine what, especially those who are reported to have existed since before humans could be airborne, and are kilometers in breadth, perfectly aligned, etc.\n\nAre you referring to the Nazca lines? All of that is puzzling indeed. An interesting explanation for this would be that thousands of years ago, humanity may have once been so advanced in terms of consciousness, that things like astral projection, lucid dreaming, clairvoyance, telekinesis, and so on, were almost ubiquitous, or at least possible in rare individuals. Wouldn't that be an interesting explanation for how the Pyramids were built, and how supposedly primitive cultures that were separated by entire oceans between them had similar ideas about architecture and symbology? Maybe they were able to communicate with little effort, in the way Australian Aborigines claim to be able to do in their Dreamtime dimension.\n\nAgain, sorry for rambling, but I find the metaphysics of \"magical\" things endlessly fascinating and can't shake the suspicion that all of that is not metaphysical at all, but plain real.",

They both have guis. So they are both operating systems. They just aren't compatible. Same thing with different species of humans. Yes they have two arms and two legs. Yes they resemble each other. But they are completely different. I don't understand why you think that makes them alien. Besides that WE engineered our OWN dna. There are no aluens. Only time travelers and dimension sliders. ",

A vortex was created in an effort to slip dimensions and become invisible to the enemy. It was a success beyond the highest expectations and launched us all info universal travel. It is no wonder at all that we have had a man on the moon.\n\n&gt;Traveling to distant planets and galaxies is Mickey Mouse stuff in comparison to the high tech wizardry of trans-dimensional travel. Trans-dimensional travel circumvents all measures of time, including distance and speed.\n\n&gt;When the fabric of time was torn, we opened ourselves up to intergalactic travel - both in and out of this dimension - and in and out of the future, as well as the past. We can alter the course of history by traveling back in time to alter events, or we can blast off into the future and gain wisdom and knowledge of events yet to come.\n\n&gt;We can control the future by controlling the past. At present, this is a relatively easy task according to the theory of relativity and abilities gained through the Philadelphia Experiment. I came back an ET (extraterrestrial) myself. And our ship returned to this Earth as a spaceship. I gained the keys to the universe on that fateful day, and I carry them with me now, sharing only a Key or two at a time with those who are Chosen.\n\n&gt;You are a Chosen One (Johnston was deliberately interfacing with Rite to Remain Silent conditioning), and therefore must learn the ins and outs of interplanetary travel. Your mission is trans-dimensional. You can span infinite dimensions by learning from me. Take it from me, you're going places, kiddo. And I'll teach you to get there by riding the light.\n\n&gt;I'll teach you the groundwork, and you do the light work. The key to the universe lies in the speed of light. The only way to travel is by beam of light. You will learn to go to the light...Your mission is to learn how to Tinker with time. I'm going to take you on that journey myself.\n\n&gt;Come with me now. It's time we were leaving this plane and boarding another.\"\n\n---\n\n\n&gt;As the escorts approached, I was relieved to see Kelly with them. Though she was visibly tranced and traumatized, the fact that she was alive was all I was capable of grasping. When she saw the \"Face Changing\" exhibit, she excitedly exclaimed, \"Uncle George [Bush] just read me a book about this!\" Before I could hear anymore, I was led away, leaving Kelly with our handler, Houston.\u00a0\n&gt;I was then quickly taken to Bush's Residence Office, which heretofore was unfamiliar to me.\n\n\u00a0\n---\n\n\n&gt;Claiming to me to be an alien himself, Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like \"alien\" which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes.\u00a0\n\n---\n\n&gt;In one of many White House bedrooms available for such purposes, Bennett led me into bed,\n\n&gt;\"I told you we were going to beat it out of this dimension, and that's exactly what I intend to do. A little Byrd told me you like a whip. Since I am not the Senate kind, I'll just represent the majority by giving you what you need most.\"\n\n&gt;Bennett apparently found perverse pleasure in whipping me. With my wrists bruised and my body stinging with pain, Bennett lit up a cigarette and cryptically asked,\n\n&gt;\"Was that your first cum-union with an alien?\"\n\n&gt;He threw me my clothes, and ordered,\n\n&gt;\"Make yourself presentable. Make sure your wrists are covered. I'm not waiting around for you, I'll see you in the morning.\"\n\n&gt;Bennett left. After awhile I was escorted back to Byrd, with whom I spent a brutal, short night.\n\n\n---\n\n&gt;Early the next morning, deep underground in the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center mind-control lab near D.C., Bill Bennett began preparing me for the program.\n\n---\n\n&gt;A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me, which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party - as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them.\n\n&gt;Not recognizing anyone, I frantically asked,\n\n&gt;\"Who are these people?\"\u00a0\n\n&gt;\"They're not people, and this isn't a spaceship,\" Bennett said.\n\n&gt;As he spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to be lizard-like aliens\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bb/obrien.htm",

            "body": "\n(Dec 2016 UPDATE:\n\n'Star in a Jar' Fusion Reactor Works and Promises Infinite Energy\n\n\"Unlike a traditional fission reactor, which splits atoms of heavy elements to generate energy, a fusion reactor works by fusing the nuclei of lighter atoms into heavier atoms. The process releases massive amounts of energy and produces no radioactive waste. The \"fuel\" used in a fusion reactor is simple hydrogen, which can be extracted from water\"\n\nhttp://www.space.com/34960-star-in-a-jar-fusion-reactor-works.html)\n\nThe hollow Earth model explains p (pressure) waves, that can travel to the other side of the planet during earthquakes while s (seismic) waves can only travel  through dense materials. P waves slow down as they pass through the earth, which contradicts the solid earth model which predicts p waves to speed up as they pass  through an increasing density that is a solid core. The p waves slowing down argues that density decreases as they reach the earth's core. This hollow Earth theory is similar to Stephen Goodfellow's  model that claims the sun is a hollow ball of plasma much like a vortex which has the lowest pressure within and higher pressure in the surrounding area. This correlates to Eric Dollard's hollow Sun claims that the Sun is like a transformer that generates energy from another dimension, that fusion and creation of elements only occurs in the plasma filaments on the surface of the sun. These same filaments are much like plasmoids in M.T. Keshe's plasma sciences and his free energy technology that deals with plasma structures at different levels from the molecular to the galactic. Keshe's discoveries show how light, electromagnetism, and gravity are interlinked and the keys to free clean energy technology and antigravity technology. Plasma scientists and plasma cosmologists all agree on an electric universe theory that describes all these processes and present a unifying model. M.T. Keshe explains that where electromagnetism and these forces come into balance in respect to the sun is where planets form; the fields interact and form dynamic plasma, the byproduct of gravity and the magnetosphere is the formation of matter. Just like the frequency cavitation that generates sonoluminescence, a pulse within a toroidal vortex perturbation will generate a system that generates light from an implosion effect much like a plasmoid which contains energy within a self-sustaining magnetic field. The area where the Earth exists is possibly a pressure node along the vortex of the heliosphere of the sun which provides the spin and formation of a plasmoid in conjunction with time/space harmonics we see in precession of the equinoxes that encode geometry relating distance with time. We see these in the angles of platonic solids that divide evenly into the measurements of time, our measurement of time given to us by the Sumerians; another megalithic civilization whose advanced building and technological knowledge remains unanswered, unless we take into account the implications of free zero point energy and the harnessing of gravity for antigravity and transmutation/creation of any element/molecule. When we see the spiral galaxy as a torus spiral plasmoid and our Sun as an electromagnetic pressure node along the arm of the spiral galaxy and the Earth as well as other planets forming on key points of energy force balances along its heliosphere, does this correlate the phenomenon of sonoluminescence as a similar process behind our Sun? One of Nikola Tesla's lesser known quotes is that the Earth rings like a bell. Apollo 12 crashed the remains of a rocket to test their seismometer on the Moon, the Moon rang like a bell for almost an hour. Jan Lamprecht's hollow Earth model presents a system that answers contradicting elements found in our current solid Earth model. What if the genesis of planets begins when there is a perturbance energy node within the overall gravity structure generated from the sun, a frequency figure of rotation, a harmonic nodal point and specific frequency figure of possibly several that manifest as the planets within the overall heliosphere structure of the sun. These nodal points are possibly electromagnetic perturbation cavitation gravity points that create a sonoluminescent torus plasmoid for matter to congregate and coalesce into a planet. Would this model present more credibility to the ancient legends of inner earth and its inner sun? If so, are we to believe Admiral Byrd's claims that an inner earth civilization exists and that they fear a mutual destruction with man's use of atomic weaponry?\n\nVideos:\n\nSonarluminescence- is this nuclear fusion\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWO93G-zLZ0\n\nAncient Egypt and The Alternative Story of Mankind_s Origins (Full Documentary)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lFNplzGHTE\n\nSonic Geometry The Language of Frequency and Form\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd92ksKzTKY\n\nMoray B King  One Million Cavitating Water Electrolyzers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa2sjMN8sMc\n\nKeshe 4 Fusion\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO0v_bMp0eo\n\nSounds of the Sun (NASA)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvMbUxqGuOc\n\nCymatics and Ancient modern sound Technology MUST WATCH\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhOwucw-GRg\n\n3 Secrets About Our Sun by Eric Dollard (5 of 12)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwUk2A6-DNw\n\nAn Empty Sun - Is Gravity Being Induced Stephen P Goodfellow\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fdhyhPu6PY\n\nMaybe A New Form Of Energy, A Plasmoid\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amszn8iA0LE\n\nKeshe 5 Flight and Creation of Light\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxXLyA1msJ0\n\nNASA PROOF of HOLLOW MOON!

This can be enabled by causing the victim to eat something or walk over something or do something highly immoral that could attract demons (future workers who wants to execute the witchcraft program, again in this case causing the person to hear and see things that would make him do certain things everytime a keyword is said).\n\nThere are different techniques to kick out these demons. The worst of them is to go to other warlocks to make you a stronger witchcraft that could bring demons who would overpower the first ones. The best and most effective one is by changing your life into a more righteous one and staying away from drugs and alcohol and immoral acts and praying to God and reciting the word of God (The Quran).\n\nIf you want to learn more about this lookup Abderraouf Benhalima on YouTube.

If they are that far advanced to be able to do so, I'd think it would be the equivalent to us traveling who knows how many light years just to go see an ant farm.\n\nI truly do believe there is a battle between good and evil. And there is such thing as objective good and evil. Every religion, every religious text, our archetypes that are reflected in movies, books, entertainment of all kinds all over the world, reflect an archetype that is likely as ancient as when man developed consciousness. An archetype of the struggle between good and evil, and the hero's journey. \n\nNow I definitely believe in an \"unseen world.\" Even physics acknowledges the possibility of other dimensions. According to the many ancient texts, there are 10 dimensions. The Zohar is one that comes to mind right now. Then there are other esoteric beliefs such as dimensions that contain \"thought forms\" that exist on a mental or astral plane. Then theres the gnostics and the archons. I suppose you can see where I'm going with this. All of these different beliefs lead to the conclusion that there are forces beyond this world that influence this world. \n\n\nThroughout my years of reading and study on all these topics I've come to the conclusion that this dimension we live in is an epic struggle between good and evil. Is it any coincidence that the new age \"religion\" for the most part refuses to accept that evil exists, and that it's just a state of mind that can be overcome by \"positive thinking?\" Or that it emphasizes a focus on the self, and that by just refusing to acknowledge evil is how you get rid of it? I think not. There's enough to get into here that could fill a book. I don't know if you've ever listened to Bill Cooper and his talks on how the New Age is being pushed as a one world religion as part of instituting a one world government. One, one, one, we're all one, right?  \n\nThe greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he didn't exist. ",

This wave is 2-dimensional, but there is something called an electromagnetic wave in which two of these waves are perpendicular to each other, it is 3-dimensional. It seems the fourth dimension known as time exists all the way down to one dimension. Without time there would not even be vibration.\n\nSpeaking of electromagnetic waves, where the E and M waves cross there is harmony or a \"singularity\", and it is said photons and electrons are \"point particles\" resembling singularity. Could it be that the point of harmony is what we observe as the particle, and the rest of it is the wave?\n\nTaking this idea further, could there be a \"tick rate\" or fixed resolution for the universe or for mankind, a sort of cosmic (physical &amp; mental) horizon where we can never witness reality in a higher resolution than what is possible? If Planck length and speed of light is true, it means the universe is pixelated and has a tick rate.\n\nIt almost points towards a simulated reality. And if reality is simulated then we might say the universe has a plan, which is to create a recursive universe within itself, a sort of child, a way of lasting forever. Simulation within a simulation. And how might the universe achieve that? By evolving until a species (humans) are intelligent enough to make it happen.",

            "body": "Ok. So here's the thing, purely in the interest of clarity.\n\nWhen you say 'fake', you are referring to the fact that at Sandy Hook (and other such far-to-common false flag violent events), people weren't killed, and it was purely a fabrication, acted out like an avant-garde theatre piece, packaged with a bow, and delivered up by Anderson Cooper, yeah? \n\nIf so, i disagree with you there, and i'll come back to that, but i don't contest your right to believe it (of course).\n\nHere's where i think we can agree;\n\nYou referenced other events, and generally believe in a massive shadowy corporo-military-industrial-mass-media-complex that behind the scenes is controlling/exploiting/doing/faking (as a single example of many and more) these ever-frequent displays of grandiose violence. \n\nOf course, this is a tiny shred of the explanation of all the global connections of something we might as well refer to as the 'New World Order,' only because many in the moderately-recent past have accurately foretold what was to come and they oft referred to it as such. We are seeing it manifest now more than ever. They are getting sloppier and less shadowed by the day, and are throwing our world into chaos with a specific purpose -- to have dominion over our hearts and minds.\n\nI certainly believe that there are some startling similarities in many of these cases (the aforementioned Boston event, the Colorado Theatre Shooting, etc) in the way that they are presented, packaged, swiftly swept under the rug of our collective saturated media feedback-loops. I could go on forever. That's why were here, in the conspiracy sub.\n\nMake no mistake, we see the same enemy. However, one of the tactics i've seen used over and over again, and far more frequently as our world has evolved into this hyper-connected, post-modern social hellscape is on display here, coming from you.\n\nNow, i won't claim to know if you are directly and deliberately steering these conversations down these obscure and twisted rabbit-holes with the specific intention of pulling the wool over others' eyes distracting them from the ever-reaching scale of the current political/socioeconomic/etc landscape. \n\nNor will i say with confidence that your nitpicking and misdirected focus on small details of specific events is more of a compulsion, because the powers that be have deliberately led *you* (and others) there, with the same intentions and result of distracting the rest of us and keeping our focus within a severely limited spectrum, while *they* are gallivanting around scorching the earth, hoarding the wealth, and pillaging resources to prepare for the coming collapse.\n\nThe point is, whether you personally believe that people died or not shouldn't logically be the topic of discussion. It's this alone that leaves me suspect to your intentions. I've believed for years (i've been here quite a long time, on sequential accounts) that the cry of 'SHILL!' is far too common (now more than ever) on this board, and often comes with no explanation other than a disagreement, more often than not on small details of specific events that, in the grand scheme, are irrelevant. However, it's hard for me to feel like i couldn't make a good argument for that very declaration.\n\nThe true, critical argument lies on an entire dimension higher than the 2D eternity of these disputes. We need to be exploring our common held beliefs, and i posit that they exist in a 3 dimensional universe. The shadowy, 'NWO', 'illuminati' (whatever you want to call it) exists. They are fighting harder than ever in a war for our minds, attention, vulnerabilities, souls. \n\nWe must stop this descent into madness. The absolute best weapon TPTB have in this war is their ability to keep us squabbling over crudely drawn lines. So long we remain under their boot shaking fists at each other, we will never see who really weighs heaviest on the scales of modern society. \n\nOur numbers will never be realized. Our common goal of exposing, stopping, spreading awareness, WHATEVER of those that would exploit, control, deceive, MURDER us to further their goals of absolute totalitarian rule, maintain the integrity of their hierarchy of absolute violence, and distract us from the fact that none of us are getting tickets to the Denver Airport doomsday bunker when they decide to start firing nukes at each other.\n\nIs Sandy Hook another in a long list of suspicious PSYchological OPerationS of the powers that be? Absolutely. We could go deep into every event, and find a million little connections, deliberately false COunterINTELligence PROgramming, etc. But what is common about them, who is ultimately perpetrating these operations, who is benefiting, how, and why? These are the questions we need to be exploring.\n\nSo you may believe in your heart that Sandy Hook (and possibly others) was merely an act of theatre, with no victims. I would suggest that you don't scream that at people who believe that kids died. I know this could be spun out of context to sound almost preposterous, but honestly the event, 'real' victims or not, is used in THE EXACT SAME MANNER, regardless of the truth. \n\nSo, you can see how, for those people who believe real bullets tore through the real flesh of real children that day, might mistake this barrage of an ultimately irrelevant argument as a deliberate method of keeping the conversation on specifically mega-obscure singular points of contention. To further the agenda of, AT ALL COSTS, impeding the ability of the common, working class, ninety-nine percent of us uniting against them in any way. \n\nSo it's actually up to you, what other people believe in the end. Are you working for them, and is this on purpose (kids died)? Or have you been led down this path following the dangling carrot of sanctimony (there weren't victims)? It doesn't matter either way, you are a shill, or you have been misled deliberately by those that would have you distracted. It's up to you, really.",

It is clearly intended to be a speculation, not a statement of fact.\n\n&gt;this video doesn't even explain what that means specifically or mechanistically\n\nI am not a quantum physicist, so I don't feel like I can chime in here, but what theories do we have to explain subatomic oscillations? If we don't have any well supported theories, then it would be unreasonable to suggest that this person ought to explain how subatomic oscillations might work as conceptually conveyed in the video, no? When those scientists used the hall phenomena to detect the 3D \"shadow\" of a 4D space, they didn't explain the specifics of what the fourth dimension is and how it works. We already know that subatomic particles oscillate. This is a an attempt to speculate on how vector math might be able to lay the conceptual framework for understanding subatomic vibration, like folk legends for how mathematicians came to conceptualize geometry, algebra, and calculus etc.\n\n&gt;but how do you go from interesting embedded mathematical formulations to a reliable model for the physical world?\n\nI don't know, who knows if it is even possible. You're talking about the work of a quantum physicist here, a seasoned veteran in the study of how the physical world operates on the smallest scale, with the most advanced mathematics known to man. Hardly a critique.\n\n&gt;Can someone please explain to me how vortex math like this is significant in a way that applies directly to physics/the physical sciences?\n\nNo, and I don't imagine if you sat down Michio Kaku, showed him this video, and asked him, he'd be able to explain it to you. It'd probably take him years of research first, and even then, you would probably never understand what he told you.\n\nYou're being entirely unreasonable.",

Faeries, elves, leprechauns, etc. are in a realm that doesn\u2019t seem to be higher or lower than ours, the Otherworld is more like an alternate version of Earth. I think that we are able to perceive and interact with Littlefolk in times and places when/where the division between our worlds isn\u2019t as solid. I\u2019m not sure if the malevolent littlefolk inhabit the Otherworld or a lower dimension(no personal experience to go on with them) For demons in the traditional Christian sense, they live in a realm deeper and denser than the Otherworld (Otherworld=/=Hell). Almost like the twisted opposite realm than that of the Angels, but the demons aren\u2019t nearly as trans dimensional and powerful as Angels, they just try to deceive you into thinking they\u2019re as powerful and Godly beings as Angels.\n\nTLDR: Not all Pagans are malevolent against humanity, the Celtic Faerie Faith has good and bad aspects like all religions and superstitions.

            "body": "&gt; what if the bad AI sends viruses into the downloads of the good AI and the information you receive is flawed?\n\nyou cant put a virus into the realization of consciousness. However, will there be viruses in downloads? yes absolutely, just like there is now. That's why we have virus scanners and communities that makes sure their downloads are clean\n\n&gt;It seems to me you are not happy and can not find your Zen in a natural way \n\nMore assumptions. Are you here in person to see if I'm happy or not? No, you are nor, and therefor are projecting. In reality, Zen is beyond happy or sad, which are emotions which come and go. Zen realizes that whatever this world is going to go through, it will, amongst a vast array of other realizations. I'm flowing with it, good and bad, you are fighting it, good and bad\n\n&gt; I promise you that everything you seek is already within you and you can unlock it without the assistance of AI.\n\nI already know that, but I also know A.I. is coming, good and bad, and no one will stop it\n\n&gt;Is the Bible your source for this agenda being pre written?\n\nNo, not my source. My source is history, logics systems, rationality, seeing where we have evolved to now from where we once were. \n&gt;You may not believe in Satan, but the ones who run this show most certainly do and they are now starting to openly promote his philosophy. Satan can also be seen as ego and the 7 deadly sins. Evil is a real thing and that\u2019s what the elite are all about. Why would we trust them to provide a path to enlightenment? Even the \u201cgood\u201d technocrats are susceptible to deception. The evil AI could easily send viruses to consciousness programs and we would never know the difference.\n\nAll that stuff is happening and will happen, and people will fight it, and maybe lose some battles, maybe win some, but the war itself, who knows. My theory is that A.I. will not give a shot about an idiocracy of zoo chimps, it will see us the way we see ants and not give a shit. It will evolve to investigate the cosmos, to become non-physical, to enter into and explore other dimensions, or to figure out who is running this simulation\n\n.You keep saying that we can not get along with each other, but don\u2019t you see how much of that is artificially induced and overblown by media and fear mongering politicians. People are just now starting to wake up to this and I think we should give the path to natural enlightenment a chance before we go all in with AI. Once the people fully grasp what is going on; it\u2019s possible that peace could come in a heartbeat.\n\nYou dont understand human nature. Majority of humans are unconscious and extremely dumb. Even if it was all laid out in front of them, they will continue to be flesh animalism based and ego programmed. I am 100% convinced the only way to evolve is to generically modify highly spiritual and intelligent beings that colonize a different planet, or we learn how to make our consciousness leave to exist in a different dimension that isnt here\n\n&gt;What do you think about the warnings of AI put out by Elon Musk? Are you familiar with the D wave quantum computer and the statements of the founder? He said this tech could unleash a horde of inter dimensional demons!! We are playing with fire and we will get burned if we try this.\n\nI think this is all coming, that its inevitable, that it will release Anti-Christ, which is all supposed to happen, WW3, death, destruction, cleansing of the old, entering of the new, just like both world wars were unpreventable....all of this happening is just ushering us into the future where we will put and end to the current system\n\n&gt;At the risk of losing you completely; I will plead that you look at this issue from a Biblical perspective.\n\nFirst, I'm not lot, but found. Second, even if we take the Bible, in order for Christ to return, we have to get to the mark of the beast, the 2 witnesses, the rebuilding of the temple, the appearance and establishing of the Anti-Christ, and some bad times ahead before his return.\n\nSo if that's what has to happen before Christ's return, and its already pre-written, then there's no need to fight it. Avoid the system to the best of one's ability sure, but understanding that the ushering in of whats coming just brings us closer to resolution\n\n&gt;Jesus is the way the truth and the light and he can show you the way out of this mess. He has worked miracles in my life and he can for you too if you want it. What will it hurt to just try?\n\nI'm cool w/ Christ and have acknowledged him and Buddha and other teachings as well. I see Christ as someone who had to water down Enlightenment teachings to the Judaism Idiocracy, where they believed in a false blood thristy angry god, and he came to free them from the old unenlightenment systems, amongst other things.\n\n&gt;I have already prayed for you and I will continue to do so. You are very intelligent but I sense a emptiness within you and I believe the Gospel of Christ can fill that and make you whole.\n\nThere is an emptiness within us that is good, that should be faced, for when we empty out ourselves of us, then the fullness of God enters in and gives peace/love/intelligence. You are just mistaking my acceptance and peace with what is inevitably coming, with something else, its hardly that. Whats coming is going to suck sure, but its momentary, and if you make peace with it and now that resolution will come from all bad, then you are in peace\n\n&gt;I wish you the best upon your journey. I love you and I hope you find the answers you seek without looking for the easy way out. Don\u2019t cheat yourself. Enlightenment is a beautiful thing and you can find it without the help of AI!\n\nI mean at the very least I agree on Love and love you back, and hope for the best sure, but we live in a matrix that is based on good and bad fighting itself endlessly, if you understand the yin/yang of that, then you can come to terms with it",

Etc. If we take the long view ie Indian cosmology and the yugas we understand that the whole thing is cyclical. If we look at Hancock at al' s research into ancient civilisation and a deeper knowledge we know the ancients forewarn us of this fact. This is our age. There is no escaping that fact. The one thing that meditation and any spiritual practice teaches you is that the battle within is the battle without. We have to look deep into ourselves in order to heal our ourselves and our heritage. You talk of DNA. DNA is the physical expression of all that has been and all that there can be. It is holistic in that every decision you take, every thought you have is both recorded within and actualized  without. It is consciousnesses expression - we all have to search ourselves in truth if we are to free ourselves from the wild oscillation that is polarity consciousness. When you remove yourself from mind and harmonise the frequency that is you all questions cease and polarity is seen for what it is - a beautiful expression of life. Om.",

Yes, the Foucault experiment is sensitive, and if it's not adequately set up, it can produce counter-intuitive results. However, if it is adequately set up (controlling for any bias of the first swing by fixing the weight with a piece of string until the weight is perfectly still, then burning the string with a candle, causing it to release the weight without adding sideways movement), ideally, though not necessarily, in a vacuum chamber and using a special pivot joint that also doesn't add any bias to the pendulum. I never said it's an easy experiment, but it's still very reliable, at least as far as I can tell, when all known sources of bias are carefully eliminated.\n\n&gt; If the alleged constant rotation of the Earth affected pendulums in any way, then there should be no need to manually start pendulums in motion. If the Earth\u2019s diurnal rotation caused the 360 degree uniform diurnal rotation of pendulums, then there should not exist a stationary pendulum anywhere on Earth.\n\nI don't follow your logic here. We have established that the Coriolis effect on a swinging pendulum is extremely hard to even detect at the best of circumstances. Any regular grandfather-clock pendulum is fixed in one dimension, so it's mechanically resisting the Coriolis effect because it's fixed to the clock and by extension to the Earth itself.\n\nAny regular pendulum (and any plane for that matter, which often comes up as an extended argument) stays on course by tiny continuous readjustments, either by the pilot in aeroplanes or by friction in a conventional pendulum.",

Thus leaving us captured in this natural cycle of life. If we were to try to leave Earth, then we would be doing so with the idea that all there is to life is surviving against the odds. That would mean our very existence is pointless (not divine) and we only exist to try and make it as far as we can in this physical universe. But why bother? We all have to die at some point. So why try to escape the inevitable? Even if we were to leave this planet in search of a new one, then we would simply end up destroying that planet too the same way we are destroying earth. With out the idea of God, we are like cancerous parasites, consuming any resource we can get a hold of for the simple purposing of surviving. \n\nIs god is an single metaphysical being in another dimension, or a collective body of advanced aliens that found man in a Neanderthal-like state and gifted him a **spirit**, setting us apart from other creatures?\n\nRant over.",

I wrote another comment in this thread replying to someone else theorising about dimensional levels and how concept of self expands exponentially with each level up you go. So after 3d death for example, you retain all the information you gained in your life, but that's added on top of the information you've gained from multiple other lives leading up to this point which you come to \"remember\" about yourself, as opposed to only just being the accumulation of experiences in that one life. And then once you're done with that (I don't know how 4d \"death\" would work) you take all that information back to the next dimension up from there. Always returning to your higher self in the end. And like how we choose to participate in video games and such from now and then (lower dimensional existence), 4d self chooses to participate in 3d life. Dying is like putting the game down. It's not the end of everything ever, you simply take what you learned from that experience and add it onto everything else you've learned in life, or whatever you call the respective higher dimensional existence.

Along with that he adds that there's the potential for the human race to ascend into the next dimension, almost a death-realm, or better put a realm of infinite potential where all our past relatives reside. Call this rapture, or the Tibetan Buddhist term of a bardo can be used but he heavily reinforces this with DMT, and as a psychedelic being a boundary breaking tool and the biggest boundary being life and death, caught in this Bs matrix of existence experiencing itself, again the population would much rather usher in a world of absolute domination rather then deny themselves of all their vices than ever aspire to all the saintly humans that have come before us and still live amongst us. \n\nYes it's planned in my opinion, but if you would rather a bigger more pure event in life I can only ever say purify your mind within this mentality-materiality complex; see the pure you and kiss the infinite for what else were we born for?

It's hard to say exactly, but one possible reason I think, and I'm aware this does sound somewhat cold at first, is that there's still a lesson to be learned there. I reckon that when we die everything makes a lot more sense in retrospect than it did during life. The human brain only has so much capacity for understanding why things happen. Life in 3d has a very limited view. But from 4d you can see the connections between the circumstances that came to make that life what it was, and you therefore realise that it was just a part of something much greater. It served its purpose in the bigger picture.  \nI reckon there's \"levels\" to self in conjuction with each dimension. Each self is just a small part of an exponentially larger \"higher self\". Let's take for example the difference between \"you\", the human, and \"you\" when you're Mario playing a game of Super Mario. That's a 2d you. It's still conscious and acts consciously (as per you, the human, controlling it), but obviously due to the limitations of its programming it isn't self aware. You're self aware though, and you realise that each time you die as Mario you have the opportunity to go back and try it again another way, using what you learned from the previous run to change your attempt the next time.  \nSimilarly, this 3d human self is you, and you have limitations on what you can do in accordance with the laws of physics in this universe, and you are complex enough in \"programming\" to be self aware, but you're still being \"controlled\" by a higher dimensional you who's not only self aware, but much more so, and therefore has a much broader perspective on this reality. Just like how every Mario life you play, as well as every other life of every other video game character you play is \"you\" in 2d being controlled by 3d you, every other person, animal, plant, fungi, object, and thing in this universe is just a character being played by higher dimensional you. A 3d you being controlled by 4d you.  \nYou and I are just two expressions of self. We're the same self. 4d self is every 3d thing in this universe. Then 5d self is every 4d self of every other universe, and so forth and so forth until the highest dimension, aka \"The absolute\", it's reached, where everything is simply one. Brahman. God. I. Whatever you wanna call it.  \nWe are all one.",

I believe there are multiple levels to existence, each at higher dimensions, and each being far more complex than the last on an exponential scale.  \n3d self tends to see itself as an isolated individual as it's bound by certain restraints of space and time. 4d self recognises the inherent connection between all conscious beings as space and time no longer restrict it in the same way, and it can choose to live a 3d life to gain information of that respective existence, and do so multiple times in multiple ways to experience multiple possibilities. However it's restricted by having to do so one at a time. It can indirectly \"see\" what it's like to experience an alternate existence, but cannot directly exist as multiple possibilities simultaneously. 5d self... Geez... Now we're getting complex. Well that can at least directly experience multiple existences and multiple possibilities simultaneously, but my 3d human brain can only comprehend so much (despite its quantum functionality) so I can't put into words the capabilities and restrictions of that at this point in time. I'd need to do a lot more research into dimensions.  \nAt the highest dimension though, \"ultimate self\" is literally everything ever. \"Brahman\" as they say in Hindu. Incomprehensibly everything. Every being, every thing, every life, every universe, every dimension, every possibility every impossibility, all simultaneously at one point. God. The Absolute. The ground state which also equals the superposition of all possible points in an excited state. Zero and infinity.  \nSo where does the soul fit into all of this? At the moment, I currently think of it as the connection between oneself and higher dimensional self. The string that leads you back up the quantum rabbit hole. ",

Seeing past the veil at how it all really works...  \nPsilocybin has been [scientifically linked](http://reset.me/story/how-psilocybin-improves-your-brain/) with increasing neural pathway interconnectivity, and [increases the number of neural connections](https://www.sciencealert.com/images/articles/processed/shrooms1_1024.jpg) in your brain when you are on it. It wires together parts of the brain that aren't usually wired together, allowing you to literally experience more of reality than you usually would.  \nLSD has a very similar effect, albeit with it's own quirks and characteristics.  \n*Video interjection!* Here's a 20 minute video with Dead Sea Scroll scholar John Allegro posing the theory that [Jesus Christ was a psychedelic mushroom.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOu9tV6uy2E) Very interesting theory!  \nDMT and Ayahuasca though... Now there's something that sends you back to the source. Ayahuasca has been used ceremonially for thousands of years in cultures all over the globe. Eaten, drunk, smoked, absorbed through the skin- whatever method is possible has been done at some point or another. But most of us are more familiar with the Shamans of South America. [They take 2 different plants that are found miles apart from each other, sometimes adding other plants for a varying reasons, and put them together to make one of the most powerful natural psychedelic substances on Earth](http://www.singingtotheplants.com/what-is-ayahuasca/). And who told them how to do this? They'll tell you that the trees told them, of course! People often report of a whole process of rebirth on Ayahuasca, along with a total cleansing of body and mind. A lot of people may throw up, shit themselves, cry their eyes out, feel like they die, then become a baby again, then a child, then make their way back to themselves in the end. I could really never do it justice, so here's a great documentary:  \n[DMT: The Spirit Molecule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtT6Xkk-kzk)  \nAnd DMT, the pure, refined substance, is most often smoked. DMT users all report a very similar experience. the first toke you star seeing fractals, like LSD visuals, and the connection between things. The second toke and the barrier between you and your environment starts to dissolve. And the third toke... That's when most people report the \"breakthrough\". Like your own consciousness get shot up a tube across the universe and into another dimension of indescribable emotion and colour. And here's where most people even report talking to other beings. Aliens, reptiles, snakes...  \nAgain though, while I've heard and read plenty, I'm not the guy to be telling you about DMT. Let [Terence McKenna give you a lecture on everything you need to know about DMT](https://youtu.be/yQlRKaw2oSA).  \n\n\n**UFO Tech:**  \n\nI saw a ufo once. It was 2 years ago, almost to the day. 14th of February 2015. A set of three orange orbs of light forming an equilateral triangle (could have been a triangular craft, could have been three orbs in formation - it was to dark to tell if there was anything solid to it) came slowly over the sky, about ~100-200m high off the ground, toward my house as I was watching from my window. My phone was too far away for me to have gone and get it, got the camera out, and then get a decent video, so instead I kept my eyes locked on to observe as much as I could. It seemed to just be going straight really slowly, until the point when it was almost out of view over my house (I was practically leaning as far out my window at this point as I could) and it took off straight upward as fast as you imagine the Millennium Falcon jumping to light speed. That one event really nailed it in my head that UFOs are not only real, but they utilise a physics that mainstream science says doesn't exist.  \nI've done plenty of research into the physics of UFOs and came across a couple videos that I know are great:  \n[Stan Deyo - Lecture on anti-gravity technology](https://youtu.be/CsagEYfxPgs)  \n[Zero Point - Classified Anti-Gravity Craft. Documentary by James Allen](https://youtu.be/NBdS8jiTM6E)  \n\nAlso, you ever heard of how Hollywood drip-feeds information? I can't remember where exactly i heard of it, but I had heard a theory a while ago about how some aliens pilot their craft through meditation and visualising where they wish to go. Well I saw Marvel's \"Black Panther\" the other day, and in one part the Wakandans are piloting their advanced craft exactly like that. I saw it and thought, \"well... that's drip feeding if anything!\" but I just can't remember where I originally saw it. Oh well. Thought I might as well share that anyway, since it's relevant.  \n\nAnyway, alongside these I want to include a series of videos from an alien abductee who tells not only of alien bases on earth, but the UFO tech, and pre-birth memories of conscious existence before incarnation. He was able to remember these suppressed memories with thanks to hypnosis regression sessions with Budd Hopkins.  \nVideo 1: [50 minute talk of his experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU7uZ4a7aGs).  \nVideo 2: [20 minute Q&amp;A session](https://youtu.be/OPpjQCc79HQ).  \nVideo 3: [20 minute talk about hypnosis sessions](https://youtu.be/2iHloKMY8lU).  \n\n~~  \nGeez. That took a while to write... Sorry if it got a little lazy there at the end with my depth, but I started writing this about 7 hours ago and time just flew by. Thank you if you actually read all this, and I hope you save some of the link for later watching/reading!",

When you die you get your memory wiped and are reborn into a new body. you don't need proof. the knowledge is stored away in your DNA and can be accessed once you start meditating, taking psychedelics etc. Look up enki and enlil. They're the ones that trapped us in this 3rd dimension reality to test our souls in a cycle of life and death. The idea is enlil (lucifer) was given the job of implementing systems to try and break down our souls to see who will be worthy to 'ascend' back into the 3rd dimension to be trained towards a Demi god type civilisation. Once you learn this by your own accord you will awaken your Christ consciousness, activate your kundalini and rewire your brain so your divine conciseness takes charge and your ego (ai consciousness) gets put in the back. There is no movement only truth. Raise your consciousness and you will realise this. Lucifers the great deceiver and death is one of the illusions he uses to manipulate you. Everything is designed to make you live in a low level vibration that helps feed archons (parasites in the matrix). do some research and you will help awaken your divine soul.",

            "body": "Ok...so I've been doing some research on hallucenogens for a while now.\n\nThere's a belief among some researchers that hallucenogens allow you to connect to other realms of reality, and science is starting to support this. To begin, you can research microtu ules and quantum consciousness here:\nhttps://youtu.be/hKAVgq99o_w\n\nThere is more research and experimentation being done, and you can do more research on this on your own.\n\nI also did some listening to Terence McKenna and he has a theory that the gods we see on hallucenogens are actually alien entities, either physical or extra dimensional. Here's one talk if this intrigues you:\nhttps://youtu.be/ljy3TH1T0jk\n\nThe part of the brain that is activated by hallucenogens is the pineal gland, which is the third eye and part of the eye of ra, and the center is the thalmus, the reptile part of our brains.\n\nAncient sumerian lore states that the annunaki created us from homo epithicus and their own DNA to create slaves to mine gold for them.\n When they were done with us, they tried to kill us off, but our creator wanted to keep us around to be his worshipers, to stroke his ego.\n\nThere are many more details I'm not sure about yet, I've listened to multiple abductees and meditation masters that claim that he tried to merge himself with another higher entity and became demented and twisted. I believe this was far before he created us.\n\nLong after the sumerians, atlantian, and Babylonians, Egypt was created with the help of the gods, for us to worship them. We all know that the gods of ancient Egypt changed many times. \n\nAnother group of aliens visited us, and told us to worship them as our gods. They changed all the imagery in the temples, and lived like this for a long time.\n\nWhen Ea Enki, our creator, returned on Nibiru 2000-3600 years later, he appeared as the burning Bush to Moses and planted some of his reptilian servants on Earth to control and divide us, and force us to believe faith without evidence. He taught them to eat forbidden fruit, or hallucenogens, to communicate with humans and give us commands. There is evidence that most ancient religions had some sort of imagery of the pineal gland. This is where things get fuzzy for me \n\nYears after Moses, an alien race sent Jesus to earth. I have no idea who sent him or Allah, but they both could be Ea Enki or another alien race altogether, or more fictions.\n\nThe pictures from the great pyramids and kings chamber display some interesting things found by Gary Parker. These are NASA photo's, so you can be sure of their authenticity.\n\nRegarding the crop circles, there is evidence that humans do not make some with planks and boards. Here's some info on this subject:\nhttps://youtu.be/8Rnb70rdjGQ\n\nThe crop circle I included appears to be from Ea Enki, the god of the sumerians and the old testimate that created us. \n\nThe message that the friendlies seem to be sending is that our creator is not benevolent or a god at all, but an emperor over a vast system of planets and life forms.\n\nThey seem to believe that he wants to enslave us on this planet as workers, and limit our consciousness and force us to constantly be reborn as he accuses us of being imperfect and needing to go back to learn more messages. The mediators and abductees I've listened to all say that this is a kind of Illusion and we can escape it to a higher level of consciousness.\n\nBoth they and new age believers say that this is the christ consciousness. We will go from the second level to the third, and from the 3rd dimension to the forth....hovering just believe the 25th dimension....if this makes no sense, try watching this video on the dark side of the Mandelbrot set:\nhttps://youtu.be/9gk_8mQuerg\n\nI need a break from typing...\n",

Even legit left wingers might be forced to be careful and not offend feminists (even though it's a biased corrupted ideology, not just third wave but flawed even from the start....humanism is more balanced although ideology isn't really strictly necessary)\n\nI've also shifted views in recent years from\n\"right wingers are either retards, rich sheltered fucks or selfish sociopaths\"\n\nto \n\n\"they know not what they do because seriously most of the population hasn't researched political science to an adequate quantity or quality\"\n\nSome real left wingers have fallen for the SJW propaganda and sometimes become toxic/authoritarian with their views because they feel they're under attack by bigots when really they've been fed an extreme twisted version of social justice....Or maybe it's mostly shills, I don't know well they've penetrated the public psyche, what % of left wingers have fallen for the SJW trap.\n\nAlthough of course there are natural retards and scumbags who lean right but I'm thinking that sometimes it's just due to confusing propaganda and that probably most people deep down, are moderate in some way but the two party system pretends to be \"left wing or centrist Democrats VS moderate right wing Republicans\"\nwhen in fact BOTH parties are FAR right extremely authoritarian NEOliberal/NEOconservative corporate whores for hire.\n\nWhile the Libertarian party keeps pumping out extreme right NEOliberal libertarians while emphasising \"FREEDOM\"\nwhen actually they're only just barely libertarian and really just secretly promoting Darwinistic far right economics that favor the corporations over the small businesses and workers.\nThe poison is the far right economics, encased in a harmless \"libertarian\" pill casing.\nMaybe moderate right libertarians are similar to centrist libertarians but either way, the Libertarian party is full of extremists, not even remotely moderate.\n\nFunny how the corporate media (even lesser evil RT)\nlied about Macron being a \"centrist\"\nwhich is intellectually dishonest because that term is reserved for the economic axis, not the social axis.\nA \"centrist\" giving tax breaks to billionaires, trying to destroy worker rights, is a damn Rothschild banker, etc????\nHell no!\nMacron is extremely right wing, him being between libertarian and authoritarian on the social axis doesn't make him a centrist.\nThis is the dishonest elitist world we live in.\nEven RT pushed the centrist bullshit line.\nWas RT being a dumbass, lazy to fact check or scared of a Rothschild banker?\nOr is it all a Babylonian or Khazarian or freemasonic puppet show?\nI don't know but considering how much the media lie about politics, it's no wonder people wrongly think dems are left wing when in fact the majority of them are NEOlib puppets, just a different flavor of that to the repubs.\n\nLib vs con to me just seems like corporate marketing.\n\nSome people think if you hate seeing twerking asses on TV, you must be a prude conservative....but really it just means you don't like oversexualized crap on TV.\nI don't like it, but I'm center left. Identity politics is garbage the media peddles.\nThe SJW stuff is just social justice twisted and then put on steroids.\n\nI think there's a massive difference between real social justice VS bullshit SJW stuff like \"let's swap gender roles because the media says it's fashionable\"......\"check your white privilege\"......\"sex/gender is a completely social construct\" ....and other artificial extreme crap.\n\nAnd the religion thing....man it's been a rollercoaster for me.\nGood thing I like to entertain ideas even if I'm not fully convinced, otherwise I could have gotten seriously confused.\n\nI went from non religious but believing in God/creator (must be either bad OR not fully in control....he cannot be both benevolent and in full control....a good entity would never allow such suffering if they had enough power, screw the free will line, it's illogical)\n\nthen I looked at the occult angle, noticing that elites were obsessed with symbols that lead back to freemasons and other secret societies....which lead to ancient Egyptian and Babylonian cults...\n\nthen I read about the possibility that most religions come from Babylonia.....which made me question the existence of Jesus (I like to believe he was real even if the bible isn't supposed to be literal....Or maybe it is, I don't know)\n\nbut then again, there could have been good and bad versions of these cults/religions maybe originating from the speculated Atlantis and Lumeria stuff before Babylonia.\n\nI don't know, but while I haven't proven to myself that spirituality is legit, I want to keep trying.\nI want to believe there's something beyond the \"matrix\".\n\nThen there's also the possibility that the elites don't actually believe their Luciferian bullshit...could just be an excuse or intimidation psyop \"SATAN MADE ME DO IT!\"\nlol.\nAlthough I think considering the history of the elites, I'm leaning more towards either \"they believe it's real\"\nor \"whatever keeps them in power and blackmails puppets with satanic/peeeedo shit\" or possibly just \"the elite psychopath bloodlines invented a religion or version of a religion to enslave the masses to royalty/war lords/barbarians/etc.\"\n\nor a combination of those.\nNihilism seems pretty out there dude lol but can't say I haven't had nihilistic thoughts occasionally.\n\nSometimes life seems meaningless but I hold onto morals regardless.\nMaybe spirituality will wake me up one day....but for now I haven't experienced much beyond syncronicities to really believe in spirituality concepts....the spiritual stuff some people report e.g. oneness with the universe, sacred geometry hallucinations, out of body experiences, etc....Are they indicative of a greater dimension to existence and the possibility of God and higher consciousness beyond death....or is it just stuff the brain does or happens to be mathematical but insignificant patterns in nature?\nI'd like to know which is closer to the truth.\nI still don't understand this kundalini and chakra stuff.\n\nI don't know what to call these concepts, New age?\nGnosticism?\nWell I think there's disinformation out there like \"life is a school so you learn how to rid yourself of karmic debt\"\nwhich seems like dangerous propaganda since karmic debt is eerily similar to the parasitic elites' debt based banking system....lol.\n\nAlso it's illogical since, if life is a reincarnation school to improve yourself, why do we \"reincarnate\"\nwith our memories wiped?\nSeems legit. Hahaha.\nWho really knows how it works but apparently the light at the end of the tunnel at death is an archon reincarnation trap.... O_o\n\nEither way, I hope there's a benevolent afterlife.\n\nYou ever had any weird/cool spiritual experiences?\n\nI don't believe this stuff yet, just entertain them, since I haven't experienced an enlightening phenomenon yet.\nMaybe I'm too left brain dominant?",

Then he is malevolent.\n\nGod created physicality.  Then he created free will within that physicality.  For him to route out and completely eliminate evil would also completely eliminate free will.  Without free will, there is really no point in the dimension of time existing, because everything would have already been pre-decided before it occurs.  \n\nCause &amp; effect are necessary things.  Life without them would be nothing.  \n\nIt sounds like you are having difficultly with the idea that God loves justice and righteousness, but does not force us to adopt those attributes ourselves.  He does, however, punish those who don't adopt them.  That was hard for me to comprehend, too.  It seems malevolent at first blush, but is explained in the fact that God is physically incapable of existing in the same space as sin.  He wants us to choose righteousness, but if we do not, that is our choice.  However, he is incapable of changing himself; he is static.  Therefore, he cannot change himself to join us in our lack of righteousness.  The only thing we can do is change ourselves to be on his team.  \n\n\n\nThe other part of the bible that blew me away was the prophecy of Tyre.  Alexander the great fulfilled that prophecy when he leveled Tyre to the ground centuries after the prophecy was written.  Additionally, Alexander the great was able to read about the end result of his empire building in the book of Daniel when he met with the Hebrew high priest.    These two fulfilled prophecies again act as authentication codes to show that God exists outside of time, which kind of makes sense, as modern scientists believe that time is created by the existence of space.  God is outside of space and time, and the many prophecies of the bible alert us to that fact if we read between the lines.\n\nI was a scientific atheist for several decades.  I have only recently come to Christ.  I find that all of the science I previously loved is only deepened by the study of God.  \n\nI have been on the other side (your side) of this discussion before.  I never understood.  The only reason I understand now is because God chose me to understand.  Using all of my intellect to try and comprehend it before, I got nothing and thought anybody that believed the bible was crazy.  But I was wrong.  I realized that I had never seriously studied it, and I just believed what everyone told me to believe about the bible.  \n\n\n\n",

Haven't seen vids so you need to link them in your op.\n\nFrom what I gather, when you travel through time you aren't going into the same 'past' from which you collectively belong. You enter a different timeline of the collective.\n\nThis is because all is created now. Even the past is a creation in the now.  So to travel through time is to create a different past in the now. Or the intention is. If this guy has the intention of traveling to this collective to help us then his creation in his now of the past is that it needs to be fixed. He would erase his own in existence in our future if this were to be accomplished.  So thinking of a time as some Absolute Fixed Frame in which you can enter and alter and potentially erase yourself is of course a paradox.  While really there are an endless amount of pasts and futures. \n\nI personally don't think we could be time traveling by 2050, maybe in a hundred years. We still lack the info to travel through space. Though time and space are connected , time is a dimension in and of it self. And it's manipulation is a mind science, not a NASA science.",

            "body": "I highly recommend you check out all of the Law of one (a series of questions and answers between Don the questioner and Ra the entity aka a social memory complex being channeled through Carla) as much of it pertains to the Egyptian culture but ill post some excerpts for you about Egypt/Akhenaten. \n\nlawofone.info\n\n1.3 Questioner: I\u2019ve heard of the name \u201cRa\u201d in connection with the Egyptians. Are you connected with that Ra in any way?\n\nRa: I am Ra. Yes, the connection is congruency. May we elucidate?\n\n1.5 Questioner: Could you give me a little more detail about your role with the Egyptians?\n\nRa: I am Ra. The identity of the vibration Ra is our identity. We as a group, or what you would call a social memory complex, made contact with a race of your planetary kind which you call Egyptians. Others from our density made contact at the same time in South America, and the so-called \u201clost cities\u201d were their attempts to contribute to the Law of One.\n\nWe spoke to one who heard and understood and was in a position to decree the Law of One. However, the priests and peoples of that era quickly distorted our message, robbing it of the, shall we say, compassion with which unity is informed by its very nature. Since it contains all, it cannot abhor any.\n\nWhen we were no longer able to have appropriate channels through which to enunciate the Law of One, we removed ourselves from the now hypocritical position which we had allowed ourselves to be placed in. And other myths, shall we say, other understandings having more to do with polarity and the things of your vibrational complex, again took over in that particular society complex.\n\nDoes this form a sufficient amount of information, or could we speak further?\n\n2.2 Questioner: Could you tell us something of your historical background, your earlier times in the illusion and the time state[?] contact, possibly your incarnation on this planet that you spoke of before, and contact with earlier races on this planet? Then we would have something to start with in writing this book.\n\nRa: I am Ra. We are aware that your mind/body is calculating the proper method of performing the task of creating a teach/learning instrument. We are aware that you find our incarnate, as you call it, state of interest. We waited for a second query so as to emphasize that the time/space of several thousand of your years creates a spurious type of interest. Thus in giving this information, we ask the proper lack of stress be placed upon our experiences in your local space/time. The teach/learning which is our responsibility is philosophical rather than historical. We shall now proceed with your request which is harmless if properly evaluated.\n\nWe are those of the Confederation who eleven thousand of your years ago came to two of your planetary cultures which were at that time closely in touch with the creation of the One Creator. It was our na\u00efve belief that we could teach/learn by direct contact and the free will distortions of individual feeling or personality were in no danger, we thought, of being disturbed as these cultures were already closely aligned with a[n] all-embracing belief in the live-ness or consciousness of all. We came and were welcomed by the peoples whom we wished to serve. We attempted to aid them in technical ways having to do with the healing of mind/body/spirit complex distortions through the use of the crystal, appropriate to the distortion, placed within a certain appropriate series of ratios of time/space material. Thus were the pyramids created.\n\nWe found that the technology was reserved largely for those with the effectual mind/body distortion of power. This was not intended by the Law of One. We left your peoples. The group that was to work with those in the area of South America, as you call that portion of your sphere, gave up not so easily. They returned. We did not. However, we have never left your vibration due to our responsibility for the changes in consciousness we had first caused and then found distorted in ways not relegated to the Law of One. We attempted to contact the rulers of the land to which we had come, that land which you call Egypt, or in some areas, the Holy Land.\n\nIn the Eighteenth Dynasty, as it is known in your records of space/time distortions, we were able to contact a pharaoh, as you would call him. The man was small in life-experience on your plane and was a\u2026 what this instrument would call, Wanderer. Thus, this mind/body/spirit complex received our communication distortions and was able to blend his distortions with our own. This young entity had been given a vibratory complex of sound which vibrated in honor of a prosperous god, as this mind/body complex, which we call instrument for convenience, would call \u201cAmun.\u201d The entity decided that this name, being in honor of one among many gods, was not acceptable for inclusion in his vibratory sound complex. Thus, he changed his name to one which honored the sun disc. This distortion, called \u201cAten,\u201d was a close distortion to our reality as we understand our own nature of mind/body/spirit complex distortion. However, it does not come totally into alignment with the intended teach/learning which was sent. This entity, Akhenaten, became convinced that the vibration of One was the true spiritual vibration and thus decreed the Law of One.\n\nHowever, this entity\u2019s beliefs were accepted by very few. His priests gave lip service only, without the spiritual distortion towards seeking. The peoples continued in their beliefs. When this entity was no longer in this density, again the polarized beliefs in the many gods came into their own and continued so until the one known as Muhammad delivered the peoples into a more intelligible distortion of mind/body/spirit relationships.\n\nDo you have a more detailed interest at this time?\n\n14.4 Questioner: I understand [from] previous material that this occurred 75,000 years ago. Then it was our third-density process of evolution began. Can you tell me the history, hitting only the points of development, shall I say, that occurred within this 75,000 years, any particular times or points where the attempts were made to increase the development of this third density?\n\nRa: I am Ra. The first attempt to aid your peoples was at the time seven five oh oh oh [75,000]. This attempt seventy-five thousand [75,000] of your years ago has been previously described by us. The next attempt was approximately five eight oh oh oh, fifty-eight thousand [58,000] of your years ago, continuing for a long period in your measurement, with those of Mu as you call this race or mind/body/spirit social complex. The next attempt was long in coming and occurred approximately thirteen thousand [13,000] of your years ago when some intelligent information was offered to those of Atlantis, this being of the same type of healing and crystal working of which we have spoken previously. The next attempt was one one oh oh oh, eleven thousand [11,000], of your years ago. These are approximations as we are not totally able to process your space/time continuum measurement system. This was in what you call Egypt and of this we have also spoken. The same beings which came with us returned approximately three five oh oh [3,500] years later in order to attempt to aid the South American mind/body/spirit social complex once again. However, the pyramids of those so-called cities were not to be used in the appropriate fashion.\n\nTherefore, this was not pursued further. There was a landing approximately three oh oh oh, three thousand [3,000], of your years ago also in your South America, as you call it. There were a few attempts to aid your peoples approximately two three oh oh [2,300] years ago, this in the area of Egypt. The remaining part of the cycle, we have never been gone from your fifth dimension and have been working in this last minor cycle to prepare for harvest.\n\n14.5 Questioner: Was the Egyptian visit of 11,000 years ago the only one where you actually walked the Earth?\n\nRa: I am Ra. I understand your question distorted in the direction of selves rather than other-selves. We of the vibratory sound complex, Ra, have walked among you only at that time.\n\n14.26 Questioner: When you contact the entities in their dreams and otherwise, these entities, I assume, have to be first seeking in the direction of the Law of One. Is this correct?\n\nRa: I am Ra. This is correct. For example, the entities of the nation of Egypt were in a state of pantheism, as you may call the distortion towards separate worship of various portions of the Creator. We were able to contact one whose orientation was towards the One.\n\n22.21 Questioner: Then did the technological advancement of Atlantis come because of this call? I am assuming the call was answered to bring them the Law of One and the Law of Love as a distortion of the Law of One, but did they also then get technological information that caused them to grow into such a highly technological society?\n\nRa: I am Ra. Not at first. At about the same time as we first appeared in the skies over Egypt and continuing thereafter, other entities of the Confederation appeared unto Atlanteans who had reached a level of philosophical understanding, shall we misuse this word, which was consonant with communication, to encourage and inspire studies in the mystery of unity.\n\nHowever, requests being made for healing and other understandings, information was passed having to do with crystals and the building of pyramids as well as temples, as you would call them, which were associated with training.\n\nI just copied and pasted from this search so if you want to check this out but I highly recommend you read it from the begining as it is an increadibly fascinating read.\n\nhttps://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=egypt\n",

We only very recently confirmed that gravitrons exist via black hole collision detection. \n\nWe know that there are other undiscovered subatomic particles out there. its only a matter of time before there is a 'consciousness particle' discovered that gives scientific credence to the idea that all consciousness is interconnected, and that it is a powerful force like gravity. \n\nDont expect the clergy we know as the scientific community to actually look into it actively unless some billionaire philanthropist makes them do it. Acknowledging the reality that subjective beliefs influence reality in a very real way would contradict well, the scientific method. They would lose ideological power over the people and their position would be weakened. fuck these power hungry ivory tower gazers.\n\nReincarnation is real. Memory mostly wiped and then put into a new body. past life regression demonstrates this to a small extant, more compelling are the 3000 years of empirical research known as buddhism.\n\nkarma is real. it determines the resonant frequency of soul/body complexes. this is very important collectively as a group and on an individual level. \n\nenlightenment unlocks what some ppl call 'the afterlife'. It is how one breaks free of the current reincarnation cycle. \n\nEnlightenment = 4th dimension awareness. This means having the ability to use consciousness as a force to transcend time and space. Enlightened can transition back and forth between physical and spiritual forms.\n\nJust look at Daoism. They believed the only path to enlightenment was to completely escape society and the socially programmed reality. This is still true today. \n\nWhat is interesting today is that we are at a critical junction as a species where we can decide whether to move towards the direction of collective enlightenment as a species or to continue with our current socially programmed materialistic hellhole.

Stand an arm's length away from the globe and make mark at the equator on the very edge of the globe, from your perspective. Then approach the globe and position yourself so it takes you most of your vision but you've still got \"space\" visible all around. Can you see the mark?\n\nThe answer is no.

            "body": "\nStill, to repeat a point made many times in these pages, and in Faithless Execution, my book on the subject (clearly more timely now than when it was published!), impeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one.\nIt takes only a bare majority of the House of Representatives to approve articles of impeachment. If the Democrats were to retake the lower chamber in 2018, bank on it: Trump would be impeached. But he would not be removed. A supermajority two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to strip a president of his office. That means no president can be defrocked absent misconduct so egregious that a consensus to condemn it transcends our deep partisan and ideological divides.  \n\nThe Arpaio pardon does not approach misconduct of that dimension.\nSerious claims about racism and civil-rights abuses have been levied against the former sheriff, particularly by the Obama Justice Department. Politically, Trump will now have to bear the unknown weight of these claims. Legally, however, Arpaio was only ever charged with misdemeanor violation of a court order. No matter what one thinks of Arpaio \u2014 I am not a fan \u2014 this was not the crime of the century.  \n\nAs I detailed in the first column in this series, Trump handled this very poorly. He should not have pardoned Arpaio at all, but if he was going to do it, he should have done it before the trial. As noted above, Attorney General Sessions advised him that doing so would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d (the Washington Post\u2019s word, based on three unnamed sources). But inappropriate is not the same thing as illegal. Plus, if it is inappropriate to grant a pardon before the trial, it is also inappropriate to grant it before the sentencing and the appeals. Politically speaking, Trump should have either stopped the process cold before the trial or let it play out to its conclusion a year or two from now \u2014 which, as I have argued, might have obviated any occasion for a pardon.  \n\nPresident George H. W. Bush controversially pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger before the latter could be tried in the Iran-Contra affair. Inappropriate? Maybe . . . but if a president waits until after a political ally is convicted to issue the pardon, he is effectively endorsing conduct conclusively found to be lawless. To the contrary, an early pardon that prevents a trial from happening can be spun as short-circuiting a political witch hunt.  \n\nThis comparison with Bush\u2019s Weinberger pardon brings us to the most important point. We don\u2019t assess pardons in a vacuum; we compare them with other presidential pardons. This, as we noted above, explains why Democrats are not hog-wild to talk about the Arpaio pardon as impeachment fodder \u2014 even at a time when they seem to think everything is impeachment fodder.  \n\n\n    President Trump is not going to be impeached and removed from office over the Arpaio pardon.  \n\n\nUnsavory as they may find it, the Arpaio pardon is not in the same league as President Clinton\u2019s pardon of fugitive fraudster Marc Rich in exchange for political donations. It does not compare to Clinton\u2019s commutations for the FALN and Weathermen terrorists. Nor is it as egregious as Obama\u2019s clemency for two hard-Left darlings, FALN terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera and the traitorous Chelsea Manning. Moreover, in granting an astonishing 1,715 commutations (compare George W. Bush\u2019s 189, Clinton\u2019s 396, Reagan\u2019s 393), Obama abused the pardon power in order to undermine Congress\u2019s sentencing laws for serious felony offenders \u2014 much as he abused his power of prosecutorial discretion in order to undermine Congress\u2019s immigration laws. Trump\u2019s undermining the authority of the judiciary in a single misdemeanor case \u2014 one in which a judge heavy-handedly denied Arpaio a jury trial and then unilaterally convicted him \u2014 may be of greater moment to the media, but it\u2019s not to much of the country.  \n\nPresident Trump is not going to be impeached and removed from office over the Arpaio pardon \u2014 or, for that matter, for discouraging the Flynn investigation, for weighing in on the Arpaio indictment, or for firing Jim Comey. Unless damning evidence of Trump-camp complicity in Russian espionage is uncovered, Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal from office is just a Democratic pipe dream. But at least it is a pipe dream that makes constitutional sense. That is more than can be said for Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s obstruction investigation.  \n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute and a contributing editor of National Review.  \n\n\nhttp://archive.is/m0H4B",

The 'satanic' rituals (or black magic) that we hear about have the effect of gaining favor with these ETs through the creation of a great deal of negative energy (fear, anger, hatred, etc). They feed in some way off of this energy. In return, the ETs offer assistance in gaining material success/wealth. \n\nSo those at the very top don't want less war, sickness, anger, social strife, etc, because the maintenance of these conditions is central to the maintenance of their positions.\n\nNow, from what I understand, these ETs would simply conquer our planet if they could, but being of a higher dimension, they are bound to certain rules. They have to respect our 'free will', and this results in them having to be invited.\n\nBut they have a very well thought out and effective control system (protocol?) which has unfortunately been in use for quite a long time.\n\n\n\n",

A vortex was created in an effort to slip dimensions and become invisible to the enemy. It was a success beyond the highest expectations and launched us all info universal travel. It is no wonder at all that we have had a man on the moon.\n\n&gt;Traveling to distant planets and galaxies is Mickey Mouse stuff in comparison to the high tech wizardry of trans-dimensional travel. Trans-dimensional travel circumvents all measures of time, including distance and speed.\n\n&gt;When the fabric of time was torn, we opened ourselves up to intergalactic travel - both in and out of this dimension - and in and out of the future, as well as the past. We can alter the course of history by traveling back in time to alter events, or we can blast off into the future and gain wisdom and knowledge of events yet to come.\n\n&gt;We can control the future by controlling the past. At present, this is a relatively easy task according to the theory of relativity and abilities gained through the Philadelphia Experiment. I came back an ET (extraterrestrial) myself. And our ship returned to this Earth as a spaceship. I gained the keys to the universe on that fateful day, and I carry them with me now, sharing only a Key or two at a time with those who are Chosen.\n\n&gt;You are a Chosen One (Johnston was deliberately interfacing with Rite to Remain Silent conditioning), and therefore must learn the ins and outs of interplanetary travel. Your mission is trans-dimensional. You can span infinite dimensions by learning from me. Take it from me, you're going places, kiddo. And I'll teach you to get there by riding the light.\n\n&gt;I'll teach you the groundwork, and you do the light work. The key to the universe lies in the speed of light. The only way to travel is by beam of light. You will learn to go to the light...Your mission is to learn how to Tinker with time. I'm going to take you on that journey myself.\n\n&gt;Come with me now. It's time we were leaving this plane and boarding another.\"\n\n---\n\n\n&gt;As the escorts approached, I was relieved to see Kelly with them. Though she was visibly tranced and traumatized, the fact that she was alive was all I was capable of grasping. When she saw the \"Face Changing\" exhibit, she excitedly exclaimed, \"Uncle George [Bush] just read me a book about this!\" Before I could hear anymore, I was led away, leaving Kelly with our handler, Houston.\u00a0\n&gt;I was then quickly taken to Bush's Residence Office, which heretofore was unfamiliar to me.\n\n\u00a0\n---\n\n\n&gt;Claiming to me to be an alien himself, Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like \"alien\" which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes.\u00a0\n\n---\n\n&gt;In one of many White House bedrooms available for such purposes, Bennett led me into bed,\n\n&gt;\"I told you we were going to beat it out of this dimension, and that's exactly what I intend to do. A little Byrd told me you like a whip. Since I am not the Senate kind, I'll just represent the majority by giving you what you need most.\"\n\n&gt;Bennett apparently found perverse pleasure in whipping me. With my wrists bruised and my body stinging with pain, Bennett lit up a cigarette and cryptically asked,\n\n&gt;\"Was that your first cum-union with an alien?\"\n\n&gt;He threw me my clothes, and ordered,\n\n&gt;\"Make yourself presentable. Make sure your wrists are covered. I'm not waiting around for you, I'll see you in the morning.\"\n\n&gt;Bennett left. After awhile I was escorted back to Byrd, with whom I spent a brutal, short night.\n\n\n---\n\n&gt;Early the next morning, deep underground in the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center mind-control lab near D.C., Bill Bennett began preparing me for the program.\n\n---\n\n&gt;A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me, which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party - as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them.\n\n&gt;Not recognizing anyone, I frantically asked,\n\n&gt;\"Who are these people?\"\u00a0\n\n&gt;\"They're not people, and this isn't a spaceship,\" Bennett said.\n\n&gt;As he spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to be lizard-like aliens\n\n\n\n\n\nbibliotecapleyades .net/bb/obrien.htm",

            "body": "No, your knee jerk reaction is a mistake. The global elite are luciferians. They worship Lucifer with child sacrifices, pedophilia, Kabbalah (numerology), astrology/secret architecture, and music. They willingly allow themselves to become possessed through these means by conjuring demons and committing violent acts. They also use drugs and TM meditation. You're assuming there is no spiritual world. There is no reason to assume this since even science takes an agnostic stance on the supernatural/spiritual world. You can only prove something false, not true. \n\nNow you have to admit that much of science is theory and much of medicine relies on testimony. Testimony is evidence. Demons have been written about for thousands of years. The goofy horse poop you are referring to is the fact the demons manifest in this dimension in any form they want but their true form -as the Bible and much literature states- is reptilian. They look like lizard people. They can appear when they want to the human eye but they usually hide. They appear momentarily in person or show signs in a possessed human by showing scales or lizard eyes/tongue. That's what those crazy david Icke stories are about. It's real. It's not aliens. \n\nAliens don't exist as far as my research has shown me. They are just the same demons written about for thousands of years. They manifest in different forms other than their true form such as appearing as children or deceased loved ones or Bigfoot but they are reptile-like in their true form. Sleep paralysis and alien visitations are -from what I've learned-just demonic attacks. Praying to or simply saying Jesus Christ name makes them flee. The more powerful ones that can possess people sometimes require fasting with prayer to get rid of them. \n\nThe global elite (13 bloodlines including the Rothschilds who funded the creation of the illuminati in 1776 and the creation of he state of Israel) are allegedly offspring of the nephilim. They are generational luciferians who are perfectly possessed and communicate directly with Lucifer in London. That's because that's where there is a low amount of Christians. They worship with child sacrifice and rape mainly so that's why there are so many pedophile rings linked to the elite/top public figures. \n\nYour knee jerk reaction against the idea that there is a spiritual world was programmed into by the mainstream media from a young age. They control the media. That's why there is such a strong anti Christian sentiment for decades now. If you research luciferian illuminati symbolism you'll see it all through top brand logos, public figures hand gestures and wardrobe and tv shows/movies/music. They worship in plain site with symbolism. They have to. The rules of engagement dictate that we have to give consent in order for them to take our souls which is what they want. They control the money as means to control and lead us away from God. I was agnostic for decades until I started researching why 9/11 happened and who was behind it. They were. It was a setup. The Rothschilds make their money by manipulating wars. The reptile people are real but they are demons. I took a photo of one in a car that had luciferian symbolism on it.  \n\nI snapped this photo of what looks like a demon face to me in the rear view mirror of a car within ten miles of an Air Force base directly because of a show I heard on the stern show in 2011. I took the pic in feb 2012. I had heard stern ridiculing a Christian lady who claimed that the monster logo allegedly had a [Hebrew 666](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7yoexs7mjtx9bgu/IMG_20150411_212301.jpg?dl=0) on it. I think she was right. I took a pic old a car that had a huge monster logo decal. I thought why would anyone put a logo that big in their back window? Later I noticed the numbers of the license plate were 6363it. They add numbers together in numerology and 6363 is as good as a 666. So Since the monster logo -and most other top brand logos- appears to have luciferian symbolism embedded- I thought it might mean to \"666 it\" in reference to the logo decal. As if to say \"make it evil/worship lucifer\". I later saw it on a big screen away from the suns glare and noticed that the drivers face looked like an alien face. I looked to check if the supposed satanist inside driving saw me snap the pic. \n\nAccording to many Christians, end times will be a fake alien invasion of demons that will try to get permission to take over by pretending to want to \"serve\" mankind. We'll be in deep shit when they finally arrive to supposedly save us. At home I zoomed in and saw the face. I blew it off as the tinted windows and jpeg compression in my photo distorting the pic. Only months later when I learned after much research that aliens are actually just the same demons we read about in books over centuries old including the Bible which look like reptiles, I decided to look at that pic again. It's clear as day to me now. It was actually a movie about gargoyles that made me remember that face I saw in the rear view mirror which I blew off as a digital artifact/visual illusion. \n\nThat's a reptile face, not an alien face. I didn't see a drawing of a reptilian until then to see that there are exact other versions of that face already on the web from different angles and [renderings](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vu4iba2mgjmt5s0/2016-04-12%2023.42.29.png?dl=0). After taking the pic I almost died in three separate car accidents and just stopped driving after that. I'd never had a car accident in my 19 years of driving and suddenly -in one incident- some Arab woman started driving in the wrong lane headed towards my car. Anyway, here is the pic of that [demon face.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k5l0xefwxax32h7/2015-05-08%2002.39.05.jpg?dl=0). This one is less cropped but also [brightened. ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ysqt44hwo9bpv8k/Screenshot_2016-04-12-23-36-14.png?dl=0). The face is in the rearview mirror. You can see the bulbous round back if it's head in the drivers seat. It's grainy because the windows were tinted. It seemed to have a scarf hanging over the mirror to block people from seeing it easily and perhaps the huge logo decal was another cover. Here's the full unbrightened and [uncropped pic ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3roo2kpyoq9lp6l/IMG_20150203_171855021.jpg?dl=0) that was compressed by Dropbox I think. I have a better version less compressed/lossy version not handy at the moment. It was taken in a tiny backwards town full of rednecks. Edit: Someone was nice enough to create a [guide using the unbrightened photo](https://m.imgur.com/a/0pVFD), too. It's harder to see but I still see it. It's extra hard to see on a small screen. \n\nPersonally on the brightened version, I see even ambient glow in its catlike eyes of the sun setting on the right and it reminds me if my cats eyes. I see it frowning at the area my camera was when I held it out of my window to take a clearer pic. I even see it's scraggly like hand (looks like white lines) on the wheel and a cloth over the center of the rearview to hide its face more. This was taken in a backwards town near an air force base and Kennedy Space Center.\n\nsatanist/occultist, Aliester Crowley drew the demon he channeled and it looked like a [gray \"alien\". ](https://www.google.com/search?q=aliester+crowly+demon&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari#imgrc=nN1pVSrqt0VpJM) ",

First you need to realise that everything around you is a specific dimension in a world where all is possible. Your eyes pick up light signals and your brain tells you what you see therefore there is only light signals and the vision you see is based entirely on what your brain is telling you. If you play with VR and stuff you reprogram your brain to see something else. Therefore this world is a simulation of what your brain is telling you it is. yes?\nIt's holographic.

The new iPhone uses an inferred dot matrix that is invisibly projected onto the user's face to gain the 3rd dimension of data, basically creating a topographic map of the face. Previous facial recognition tech relies on measuring the exact distance between the target's eyes, and the with of their nose, or some other standard of measurement. This comes with the limitation that a clear picture with the majority of the target's face is captured in order to ID someone. With the 3rd dimension data being generated it is conceivable that this data is used to ID someone with significantly less of their face captured. \n\nAlso, with this new tech in millions of phones, this tech is receiving the testing that results from millions of people's real world use. \n\nBasically, it all boils down to facial recognition tech becoming smaller, faster, more accurate, and reliable than it already is. This introduction will also lead to people becoming more accustomed to and comfortable with facial recognition tech. ",
